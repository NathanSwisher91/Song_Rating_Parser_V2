Before you can run this script at all, you'll need to download python from here https://www.python.org/downloads/
I have version 3.7.2, so get that version just in case, should be the latest.


To use the script. You will need to download Overall, Comments, Averages, and Compatibility sheets as CSV files.
In google sheets, just go to File -> Download As -> Comma-seperated values (.csv)
You have to do this individually for each sheet.
Make sure each file is named accordingly (Overall.csv, Comments.csv, Averages.csv, Compatibility.csv)

Then put these 4 files in the same folder as the python script (and this README)

Now you need to go to this folder in a terminal and type 'python Song_Rating_Parser.py'

After hitting enter, there should be a "Results.txt" file that contains everything you need!
