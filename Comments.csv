Super Junior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Twins,this song was mixed by my dog but the vocals are okay?,The rock aspect reminded me of the music my dad used to play and the dance break music reminded me of Twisted Metal. Both pleasant memories for me. (wtf is wrong with Heechul's face),,I never heard Twins before... it's aiight,Pretty bad debut,,https://i.imgur.com/IlwywMx.png,"I was peer pressured into giving this an 11, so I didn't. (egg)",,,"I liked it a lot more before the weird english section. The background was doing interesting stuff, that you don’t hear much of anymore in the kpop realm.i wish there was more of that style!",A lot of,Decent start,This is epic,"11/10 hair, bring back boy group anime hair.",,wow very cool so epic,Gives you the early 2000's kpop feel. With the good bad and ugly hair cuts that come with it.
Miracle,"i sort of like it if im listening to it through my headphones but like, my headphones arent on my head, the audio is just kinda muffling out of the ear cups and it's really hard to distinguish what's being said yeah",Cute Suju is great but that dance break section is so out of place.,im honestly in awe of how bad this song is,,,,"life could get better, this song too. thx suju","Honestly I liked the chorus but meh most of the rest, the dance break is a bit long",,,"This is the type of guy group song I hate. Just, why? I feel like every group has a song like this, and i hate almost all of them. Even the early Nu’est one called Sandy.",Early Super,Its nice...I guess,"This is so cheesy, the dance break killed me. It could be a guilty pleasure for me in the future though",11/10 rock version from concerts,,,
U,huh well that's certainly a song that was produced and released for the public now isn't it,"Chorus is good but that is it. (Seriously, who taught Heechul how to act?)",oof that mv,Started liking it once I saw SVT do a cover of it,,,espanol gita reminds me of Like I Love You by Just Timber. also sounds like a backstreet boys song,"It's so repetitive, I can't stop thinking 'bout how I wanted it to have more variation",,,"This is the song I think of when I hear Super Junior. I love it, its really dated but I dont care. So catchy that you will never get it out of your head. Maybe a little repetitive though. I really like the vocals in this also.",Not this one,My favorite Super Junior Song For sure it just hits all the right 2000's pop music notes for me.,This is such a classic boy band sound. Is it good? I don't know... maybe. The vocals are good,11/10 Yoona cameo,,Gettin' those '90s vibes,
Don't Don,haahahAHAHAHAAh,More of my dad's music and Twisted Metal. The violin was a pleasant surprise.,i actually dig the metal but the rapping is garbage,Like Twins.... it's aiight,,,"its like suju sang over a Disturbed nu-metal track, with shitty Disturbed screams in the chorus included","Not sure how to not sound like I'm ripping this one apart but I just got bored. Shout singing half the time, sucky bridge",,,"The intro feels straight out of an early step up movie. The guitar is cool. It takes way too long to get to the vocals. I really like the guitar in the background. Rap is really fast but sometimes also feels weird at times too. The instrumental/dance break needs to go though, there is already enough of an intro at the start without singing. That really brings down the songs score. Violin and guitar at the same time sounds like they didnt know what to do so they put them together, it sounds busy there.",Junior songs,Nice Violin solo Henry!,More like don't play this song near me,"11/10 hard rock instrumentals and screaming, 12/10 violin solo",,,Don't don is early suju and a lot of mid 2000's kpop at it's worst.
Marry U,"so, youve decided to release this song: here's 10 reasons why you should reconsider",The talk rap is too much bad. I absolutely can not listen to this song. Also since when did the cute love song need the mv on crack?,deserves a 0,Not very memorable,,,a bland love song,"Needed more ballady type elements for me, the constant percussion line gets stale and should have been hidden a lot more in the background mix",,"That Heechul opening is exceptionally bad, and the song is so boring. It was originally a 2.","I like this better than miracle. Something about this feels less cutesy, and more romantic. I also like the rap. Its meh, but seems like a great wedding song.",Are bad,ehh never cared for this type of super sappy,"I initially rated this a 3, I don't know why. It's pretty sweet sounding",11/10 white suits,Yikes,This is actually painful.,
Sorry Sorry,i have had enough of boy groups covering his goddamn fucking song seriously what the hell,You're in denial if you say you don't love this.,unapologetically fun,Iconic but meh,,,eat shit felix its a classic,Despite the over-saturation of auto tune around that time it's used tastefully here so I appreciated that,,,,I stan this song but because of Shinee,"The first song I discovered after SNSD's Oh!, still catch and fun to this day!","Iconic, don't @ me",11/10 choreo and catchyness,,I bought this song only having heard the chorus. Didn't realize the verses were absolute shit until it came on while I was driving.,It's iconic. With the dance and the mv it would be a 10 but just the song on it's own losses some points.
It's You,"i mean, i guess? like i mean, sure, why not, but like; why?","The galloping sound should of never been a thing, otherwise it is amazing.",would be better if it had a consistent tempo,Better than Sorry Sorry,,,,If I was a teenage girl I might swoon so I gave it +1 for that,,My favorite Suju song.,,I sing Yesung's high notes full volume no matter where I am.,Scratch that this...THIS is my favorite SJ song of all time....sooooo amazing!,"This song is pretty memorable, not sure that means I like it",11/10 falsetto echo,I’ve loved this song for forever and I still don’t know why uhhhh,,Super Juniors best song. Song that got me into super junior
Bonamana,heheh funny song title :),Why is only Donghae randomly a magician?,,,,,Fun fact: Apparently they slipped Michael Jackson's choreographer a two dollar bill for his sloppy seconds.,"보고봐도 sounds like ""Poke her butthole""",,,"Of their “catchy” title tracks this is my least favorite. I really like when they are all singing together, but dont love the rest.The background is so basic and repetitive. This is a case of the song aging, and nostalgia can’t save it.",I like but not everyday,Another bop woot woot,This song annoys me,11/10 autotune,,This slightly sounds like Hit That Drum,
No Other,very interested in the people who thought those synths were ever supposed to be used like that in a song,This is the correct kind of cute concept.,the opposite of :shindong_nice:,,,,bro they raided bieber's studio again,The background adlibs and harmonies are what saved this from a lower score,,,,Nope,Its the better of their super sweet songs but still doesn't blow me away,"If I was a boy band member and I had to record, sing and dance this song... I'd rather shoot myself in the foot",11/10 VW Bug,,Whoa referencing another song within the song? cool,
Mr. Simple,"this song is actually good for the first 30 seconds and i was about to be like, ""hey, super junior finally did something!"", and then apparently someone shot the producer with a .45 for daring to make a good song or some shit as the MV fades to black seriously what in the everloving fuck","I could never skip this, it is a classic.",,Better than Sorry Sorry. Top 5 SuJu song for me,,,,"Listen, I love this song, but rating it makes me realize how musically uninteresting it is. Fuckkkkkkk",,,,Super Junior blow your mind,"Because I naughty naughty, the second SJ song I discovered back in 2011 wow time flies. I prefer the b sides in this album tho.","Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before",11/10 because I naughty naughty,,,"Great song that I am surprised still works so well, didn't think I would,"
A-CHa,the beats kinda weird on this one in comparison to everything ive listened too before this but at the same time it still sucks so i mean \ o /,Vocals when they happen are great but otherwise nothing too special.,,,,,"SM really loving Chas, first with f(x), now Suju, i fuck the instrumental tho",This song sounds like something I made in garage band when I was a kid.,,,,Yesung back with his aggressive adlibs,This song bangs,A lot of noise,11/10 weird half glove on one hand,,,
"Sexy, Free & Single",starting to doubt whether we are really that different as a species from my cat who enjoys repeatedly ramming her head against the table leg,I love bingo but I'll never understand who'd okay this English.,B I N G O,,,,Beginning of the song sounds like someone farting into the mic. Also BDSM concept i stan,"Me: Free & Single, never manage to mingle",,,,This song holds the same spot in my heart as Run Devil Run,Was never crazy about this one either,I know I shouldn't say anything about the MV but the MV has given me many laughs in the past. When K-Pop was very new to me I showed it to my friends because it's hilarious,"11/10 ""I'm ready to mingle"" would have rhymed better and fit the song....",The epitome of cringe,It sounds like someone is slowly ripping out a fart at the beginning,Another iconic song that works better with the mv and dance then just on it's own.
Spy,i mean at this point i am seriously done with all of these suju songs they're just... so bad. i think i'm gonna make some toast or something yeah toast sounds good,It genuinely pissed me off the main vocalist voices had to be messed with so much.,had potential but doesnt quite come together,It was good for it's time...,,,Immigrant Song by Led Zep,Thank god for the bridge or I'd give it a 1,,"This is weird, the chorus and the spy theme doesn't fit together at all.",,Not a fan,Like the James Bond omage this was,I like spy themed stuff usually,11/10 S.P.Y. part that doesn't fit the rest of the song,,,This is the worst super junior song. The concept is great and trying to do I bond thing should work but for some reason it doesn't
Mamacita,should i put peanut butter or vegemite on my toast? ive accidentally taken both out of the pantry,"First Suju song I ever added, I have a soft spot for it.",:no_entry_sign: :tongue:,,,,,"Midi instruments booo, -2",,"Love the No Diggity vibe, even though it's mixed with Latin.","That line, that line lowered its score one number.",Iconic English lines,I liked Kangin's Cabbage man scene,I'm glad I relistened to this because I rated it quite poorly. I don't like the ay yayaya though,11/10 Siwon mustache,,,
This is Love,you guys ever feel like youre staring into the void and the void stares back? haha anyways i think my toast is up,Guilty pleasure of mine.,,,,,yeah this is love to my ears,"Groovy rhythm , great jazz piano chords, harmony hidden in the back",,,,I like the live stage,Mature SJ is appreciated,I like it,11/10 Heechul's Carmen Sandiego look,,,
Evanesce,"update: the toast is pretty good, went with peanut butter this time. mightve put me in a better mood yknow this songs not as carcinogenic as the others",This song is just all around beautiful.,,,,,TELL ME WHYYYY this song is actually good,Yeah just not into this one,,,,Once again it depends on the day,OH DAUM this was nice,Oh this isn't evanescence,11/10 guyliner,Favorite Suju song hands down,,
Devil,no but seriously i like this song,Every thing about this is gold. Ryewook's era! (Was up for possible 11),,,,,,"Tight percussion, awesome guitar which blends perfectly in the mix. The minimalist bridge really sells the song.",,It's basically the Korean vesion of Happy by Pharell.,,This is Yesung's return and Kangin's last video,It does its thing,"Very good, groovy and fun",11/10 cheap explosion effects,High key a bop,I'm slowly becoming more and more attracted to Siwon with each video. Also why does nobody ever talk about this song? It's fantastic.,One of the most underappreciated suju songs. It needs more love
Magic,i think i've just had a moment of lucidity or some shit guys t-the song is good THE SONG IS GOOD ITS FUCKING GOOD GUYS,One of my favorite mv of theirs. The song is also adorable.,eh,,,,funk,It's got good things and bad things,,,,Extremely skippable,Liked this more than i thought,"I initially rated this song a 7 and thought devil was the better of the two, but on repeat relistens I absolutely love this song. Something about the chorus is so infectious I just wanna sing along",11/10 blonde Heechul,,,
Black Suit,look it's not as good as the last 2 but t-they're improving guys suju has finally done something,I love the build up to the chorus.,,,,,,Great big band feel,,,,Watch the 2017 Mama's and tell me you don't like this song,A bop,This song is a grower. I don't love everything about this song but it has some really good bits,11/10 for real,B O P ❗️❗️❗️,,
Lo Siento,god fucking damnit,"One of my favorites of 2018, great route for them to head musically. Also Leslie Grace is a goddess.",tbh just get rid of suju and have leslie sing the whole sing,,,,,God damn latino inspired music is catchy. If mexico started producing pop groups with kpop quality I would probably jump ship,,,One of my favorite songs of 2018. They have managed to blend latin music with korean music really well.,The ultimate tropical house song. *lowkey I really want Ryewook to do Leslie's part.,A hot Latin BOP,Pretty catchy and good use of the Latin sound,11/10 KARD Version,Bop! THE BOP!,,
One More Time,"i cant even make a joke here, this is the most soulless of soulless pandering of all time, this song is like what would happen if pitbull decided he wanted a ""k-po inspired"" lead single jesus christ",Great Latin vibe just wish Reik got to do a little more like Leslie did.,,,,,La cancion esta bien. Super Junior realmente ama los instrumentales españoles ahora,The head bob at 2:50 in the MV is me when I listen to this,,"Somehow I like this song, even though I usually hate Latin pop, but it's also much better than Lo Siento.",,Reik didn't do it for me,HI Reik whats good,Go away Despacito 2,11/10 self inflicted cactus wound,,This may be the most forgettable song to ever exist,I love super junior doing Latin concepts. They meld the two genes really well for me and it was one of my favorite songs of last year.
Total,"to use a super smash bros analogy here: i feel like i was being constantly knocked off stage again and again, but still coming back for no apparent reason, and then i finally landed, and it was this magnificent landing, and just as i was about to do something i'm thrown off the stage once again and dunked even harder than i was at all throughout the game","Super Junior can do the cheesiest of things and can still make it great...just not Marry U, never Marry U!",meh,Not as good as SHINee,Some pretty terrible songs in here. Their recent stuff is mostly good though.,,"Rough start, but their mid to later title tracks were very good (apart from Otra Vez)","Super junior has a shit ton of songs, and some of them are great/iconic but some of them suck. I'm more into their later sound. Still a legendary group that somehow made it through 50 different controversies",,"Suju is very mixed, some really bad, boring and dated songs, and some really good ones.","I love them. I may not like all the members or even know all their names/faces but I love them. Their songs have been consistant bangers since 2011. Even if they arent artistically great, you can always dance/sing to them. Also Heechul is the best.",One of my top 5 boy groups. More than their music I love their genuine friendship.,"UM wow I like their songs more than I thought, they were the first male kpop group I discovered so I guess that could be it. I'm glad that their sound has matured well with age and I hope they continue to take on Latin America and South America by storm.","Early super junior was wack, I was surprised by how much I liked Devil and Magic",11/10 iconic songs and hair,"They’re the classic 2nd gen group who so many people look up to, so despite cringey old stuff, they outsold with a good amount of their music that’s the tea 💅🏻",Did people actually think they were cool?,Super Junior is an amazing group that has been able to adapt throughout there time in kpop and they have been able to put out quality. Super junior is one of my favorite SM for that
Big Bang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We Belong Together,that was pretty rough,Really boring but still better debut then I expected for the time.,no thanks,,This a park bom joint,,hard carry park bom,"Takes me back to a time. A weird time of awkwardness for me personally, but a time nonetheless.",,This is Park Bom feat. BigBang.,"I have realized that I really don't like Bom's style of singing. It almost sounds like she has something in her mouth and is trying to sing around it, or has a loogey stuck in her throat. The fact that she is the bulk of this song ruins it for me.",Early 2000's r&b is my favorite genre of music and predebut Park Bom vocals. Soo.........,"OH god the fashion, hahaha wow I always forget how they were pushing the hip hop/rnb look for the longest time",Young G-Dragon so cute,"11/10 Sliding camera phone, bonus points for red mustang",,This is so 2000s,
La La La,the chorus is grating,"Seungri's part was the best otherwise it is just a Korean B2K song/mv mixed with a little old Justin Timberlake at the end. I'm also mad they never actually said ""shit"".",the rapping sucks,,no no no,,Those dreadlocks make me shudder,Everybody get in line to burn this track. Holy shit it did not age well,,"Wow, this sounds so old, like 90's boy band old.",Its good.,"I, I, I, I like that real shit and vocalist GDragon",This song gives me such 2000s hip hop vibes from the types of songs i listened to in elementary school,This is obviously dated but it's so charming,11/10 90s boy group rip off,,Old Big Bang feels so nostalgic even though this is my first time listening to it,
Forever With U,i dont DESPISE it but it's super middling for me,Was gonna get a 6 off Bom alone but Gdragon's talking bit at the end brought it down.,"ironically, bom is the best part of this song",,this a park bom joint,,hard carry park bom again,Unpopular opinion? Bom shouldn't have featured on this track,,GD's whisper is fucking creepy.,"Same response as we belong together, there are no other female voices to balance out Bom's gratingness. I like GD and TOP in it, but why did they release this as a big bang song when no one else from the group was in it?",MY kind of music,It is really weird to see Park Bom with only a little plastic surgery then,A little slow and one note but holy hell is that Bom?,11/10 Wearing a hood with a hat,,"Did YG just not care about Seungri, Daesung, or Taeyang?",
Dirty Cash,1,"Surprisingly enjoyed this, the record scratching became a bit much. But the guitar is really good.",:kaeun_wat:,,this is good,,YHS i dont want your dirty cash im not rating this 10/10,"I hate myself for liking this more than I should, it's pretty repetitive and boring really but fuck it, 6",,,Not a bop.,I did not know this existed but I am comfortable never hearing this song again,,What the hell is this? It's like a shitty theme song for a children's tv show,11/10 Cross dressing,,,
Lies,"okay i love this song so much, i know i normally make fun of these weird cringey late 00's songs with kinda barebones production but honestly i love everything about this song and nobody can take that from me",Chorus is gold & this is when T.O.P's rapping started to shine. When will the end talking end!?,,,,,,"Yeah you guys remember calling a girl but being too scared to speak when she answered? I don't, I was playing with legos",,,,Another classic,A classic and I'm glad they got popular with this one. Unknown Phone Number is also a good one from this mini,I thought I didn't like Dirty Cash but I can at least see that song as a guilty pleasure. This song ain't it,11/10 Murder,,,The first step in big bang actually become a group that put out good music
Last Farewell,issa aight,The laser sound effects really piss me off. Chorus is still great as usual though.,oof,,,,,"I'd rate the intro music 10/10, love the arrangement",,This is most definitely incredible.,Very much a sound of the times.,Can we bring this sound back please,Good but Haru Haru tho,"This is bad, why does the song burp in my ears... Rude",11/10 Club banger,,B TO THE I TO THE G (BANG BANG),
Haru Haru,it's like lies 2 oh my god i love it,It just has to be rated high.,a classic,,,,finally a good early big bang song,Haru Haru is a representation of every emo teen growing up in the 2000's. We thought we were cool tough badasses but in the end we were all just confused and unsure of our place in the world. Also we were horny. I regret this comment,,,Lies 2.0,The acoustic version always gets me in my feelings,"MY FAVORITE 2nd GEN BOY GROUP SONG OF ALL TIME, Lucifer is a real close second",The chorus is okay,11/10 Big Bang Civil War,CLASSIC,,
Sunset Glow,"this is like the beginning of bigbangs ""its ok"" era",The background mix is far too loud.,es no bueno,,,,,"Song is alright, MV is better",,Don't know what this is.,Forgettable.,Nope,"I wish people talked about this song more this was great, and this album also gave birth to the fantastic Seungri solo Strong Baby God Bless","Kinda fun but nothing special about it, old and therefore bad",11/10 Party bus,,,
Tonight,its ok,Decent hype song.,tOoOOoOooniIIIiiIiggGhhTtT,,,,,Too much autotune,,,,A bop,"Also doesn't get talked about as much, the auto tune doesn't bother me as much as i thought it would",Classic,11/10 Chloe Bennet,,"Ok, these intros are starting to get on my nerves",
Love Song,its ok numero tres,Loved the mv & the build up to the chorus. Could of taken the chorus a little further though.,,,,,"i hate this love song too, and the choreo too",Good old moody MV of people walkiing around and starting at nothing,,,I hate this song I'm singing...,I mean you can't beat this song,very nice mv,I know we're not meant to rate MVs but I love the MV and also don't hate this love song,11/10 Single shot MV,,lol Big Bang doing synchronized dancing is just wrong,
Blue,i like the chorus and i like gdragon,The sound quality finally upgraded. Always really liked this song.,,,,,,It's fun to pretend I can actually sing along to this song,,,,I skip this song a lot,"The Alive album is one of my top 10 favorite kpop albums ever, also this song slaps so much",I used to listen to this song on repeat for dayysss,11/10 Manhattan Bridge,,dabadee dabadi,
Bad Boy,"oh my god, its a really bad song",It's good. I always think of loser when i hear this & think how much better loser is.,,,,,i prefer the red velvet cover,I would give this an 8 if there were more drum variations/cymbals,,,,This started the shift in their music for me,The aesthetics of Chicago is a cool back drop,This song made me wanna be as cool as Big Bang even though that's impossible,11/10 TOP skull necklace,,This isn't Red Velvet,
Fantastic Baby,its iconic and memorable enough to block out some of the lameness,Classic feel good that you have to love.,catchy but kinda annoying,Iconic,fun but overrated,,wow,How fantastic would it be to have a baby break dancing in the music video?,,"GD's hair in this MV, is the reason I din't get into K-pop before I did.",,The ultimate hype song,The MV is ICONIC KPOP. Also a great party song,It might be overplayed but it's undeniably hype,11/10 GD Hair,I literally can’t stand a second of this song. At all. Ever.,,I wanna dan- dan-dan-dan-dance. Iconic
Monster,im not the biggest fan of this one,"Nothing to say, just didn't hate it.",,,masterpiece,,i prefer the EXO cover :big_banger:,"The Bridge... pace grinds to a halt, call and response, introduce a heartbeat, SWELL, fade out, PIANO SLAM. Ah shit it gets me every time",,,,Sometimes I like this song,Great repackage honestly,"The MV is hilarious (nothing to do with my score). This song I found myself not really returning to, it doesn't do much for me.",11/10 Shoulder pads,One of the first bb songs I’ve ever added to my playlist,This isn't EXO,
Loser,this is a bANGER AND A HALF,I know too much of the lyrics of this song to not give it a 10.,sorry but i dont fuck wit this,,,,better than the one by Beck,"If I gave this a higher score then it means I resonate with the song, which means I'm a loser. I REFUSE TO ADMIT IT (kidding)",,"So sad, but so good.",,I just don't relate because I am lit and not a loser,Also great Love it!,"I will always listen to this song, it's a big mood",11/10 Daesung acting,,This isn't Beck,
Bae Bae,another solid track,"People always love this song, but it does nothing for me.",bad,,,,,I wished that taeyangs sang the chorus one more time becuase his voice like honey here,,,I somehow forget how this song goes as soon as I'm done hearing it. Had to listen to it three times cause everytime I went to rate it I forgot what it sounded like.,"I love the funkadelic vibe of this song. I am not saying drugs were involved in making this song, but TOP",Again I loved the BGM in this song like wow,This might sound dated in the future but not just yet,11/10 Sexual imagery,,,
Bang Bang Bang,at first i didnt like how the chorus went but now im a sucker for it,Those classic YG switch ups though!,wack,,a classic,,,"Not going to lie, the very first time I heard this song I hated it. After all this time I still prefer verses but fuck who can honestly hold back when the chorus drops. FINGER GUNS OUT!",,,,I love a gunshot audio,I don't care what people say I loved the drop,"The sequel to fantastic baby everyone deserved. Thank you Big Bang. Am I basic in giving this my 11? Probably... But it has given me so much joy, I just had to do it",11/10 Flamethrowers,,I used to really hate the chorus to this song. It's so jarring. But now I jam out to it.,
We Like 2 Party,YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH,"The original, better, fxxk it. Also this song represents no group better than BigBang.",ass,,,,,Starts off with promise but the chorus is rather weak (it's shit) for big bang. I could find a better chorus by throwing a rock at a map of nashville,,"The One Direction like chorus is really annoying, that's not how I want K-pop to sound.","I should like this song more, but it sounds almost like a one direction song at points.",skip,nice,"This song is so wholesome, yet I can see myself wanting to skip this in the future",11/10 silly dances,,This isn't the Vengaboys,
Sober,woah this so nice,Paige's comment.,really annoying,,their best song,,,The drums during the chorus sound like what you would get from a kid on his first drum set,,,,OG Big Bang Flashback,I related to this so much in college,Great MV. I'm not sure how I feel about the song. I don't dislike it at all but it doesn't have much that makes it special to me.,11/10 TOP doing drugs,My favorite bb song (: this song is seriously the most perfect way to end a concert. The ending with everyone in the audience and bb clapping together and screaming “LA LA’s” is just SO PERFECT.”,can't relate,
Let's Not Fall in Love,yea,Cute but pretty boring.,,,,,lets not,The weird synth during t.o.p's first part was kind of interesting. That's really it.,,,,boring,LOVE LOVE LOVE,Simple but a good time,11/10 Trashing a convenience store,,,
Fxxk It,mastapeece,"Vocals & raps, its all outstanding. Just wish it got a tiny bit hyper.",,,,,a song about jacking off to porn gets a good rating from me,About 2 choruses too long for me,,,,I wanna get down to this song,My current mood,"Spotify radio always throws this song at me, I'm not complaining though",11/10 Edge-lord swearing with x's,,"This song somehow makes it into every kpop playlist I make. The one Big Bang song that was a contender for the 11. Not to sound like Jacob, but it's one of my all time favorite kpop songs.",
Last Dance,not as good a final song as fxxk it,T.O.P's ending makes me cry every time.,"this aint it, chief",,,,,"A soul searching song, bridge has wonderful string arrangement, and I love key changes. Put a key change in the song and I'll give it at least 2 points even if it's utter complete garbage.",,TOP's voice here is amazing.,,skippable,SO heartfelt,It’s emotional but I think it could be more,11/10 Farewell song,,This isn't Donna Summer,Really sweet goodbye to big bang for a while
Total,as much as yg is corny and shit big bang is a pretty important group for kpop and managed to release a lot of surprisingly not atrocious music,"They really are THAT group, you can't hate them.",grating vocals on stale beats,,I actually like big bang wow,,"earlier tracks bored me to tears, later big bang was alright tho","The BB songs I like, I like a lot, like really like. Really. I hope BB comes back soon and isn't locked up in the dungeon",,"A lot better than I thought they would be, cause I'm not always the biggest fan of Teddy and YG's style of songs.",Who doesn't love Big Bang?,Pioneers,"I Love BigBang soooo much like wow they are a huge reason I care about YG artists honestly, Kind of wished Flower Road was on here but oh well",A bit of a mixed bag but their best songs I absolutely love,11/10 Sentimental rapping,"High key a TRULY DOMINANT and iconic group, it’s just sad I truly despise a few of their songs","Big Bang was the first 2nd gen group I really got into. GDragon is my ultimate bias, and I can't wait for him and the others to come back from the army so I can experience a Big Bang or GD comeback. Big Bang is a group I desperately wanna see live someday. Their concerts are amazing!",I enjoy some of big bang's music. They started out meh for me but over time I grow to like more and more of there stuff. And a lot of their newer stuff is much better in my opinion
SHINee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Replay,solid,One of the best debuts to this day.,they cant all be winners,First song that got me into k-pop.

2PM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10 out of 10,jay park idol LMFAO,The only success I can see out of this song is the girls in the mv.

Actual session musicians always make or break songs for me. Catchy song, tasteful synths, wooo",,,,I performed this song in college at a Korean Festival. So this song holds a special place in my heart.,Classic scarecrow dance,HAHAHAH,11/10 Jay Park Gone,,"The opening raps are so cringy. Are they even raps? It's like lazy monotone singing that's also fast. I dunno, it sucks.",
Without U,beat is good,"Nothing really stood out, the piano was nice though.",,,wow theyre just bad,,wow 2010 kpop really loved the shuffle,"Musically: key change was the only good part. MV: If you have beastly idols in the rain, why bother with shirts?",,,,,First time watching this and wow black tanks and wet men are really nice to look at,This song would be a lot better if the vocals were better,11/10 sentimental rapping over a piano in the rain,,Did anyone else shiver at the jyp whisper?,
I'll Be Back,"these songs do kinda blend together a bit for me, not terrible though",I swear I've heard the same song 3 times straight with this group.,,Just no. T-ara's shuffling was better,,,Arnold oppa should sue,I can't not talk about that overthetop eye shadow holy shit.,,,,I just like this song,"that makeup and hairstyles and clothes were horrible, no bueno","The MV has me giggling so much, why is it so damn funny",11/10 Eye makeup,,I imagine kpop hell is this song on a loop with everybody shuffling.,
Hands Up,:/,I make my cat dance to this song! The mv quality improvement is also much appreciated.,,,,,the frat song,The sample literally never stops. Wish it changed at least once?

Come Back When You Hear This Song,no,"The build up to the chorus is really good, chorus itself though is disappointing.",,,finally a good song,,,"It's disjointed, and I don't like the mix",,,"I don't know why I love this song so much, but I do.",This song reminds me of History's The Dreamer,also really nice song,This song grew on me,11/10 Deadly sins,,,Underappreciated gem
A.D.T.O.Y.,i actually really like the chorus in this,This is how you appropriately make a sex song.,even a broken clock is right twice a day?,,improving,,,"Rap is fire, song is a bit too high for junho in the chorus I didn't like that",this music video though,"This song is the best song JYP has ever written, it's so fucking catchy.",,Hands down their best song. One of my favorite kpop songs of all time.,HOT HOT HOT all day i think about youuuu,This song is so unique and interesting but the vocals I find are kinda weak especially the falsetto,11/10 Falsetto,,Clearly I'm missing something. Why does everyone love this song?,One of the sexiest kpop songs of all time.
Go Crazy!,YEAAAAAAA,Still one of the best party songs in k-pop. This mv is a whole trip though.,really good chorus but everything else is a trainwreck,,a jam,,,"Bass & rhythm guitar were spot on mate, some cool filters near the end",,,No.,,The mv never fails to put a smile on my face,"This song is pretty fun, I love the verses but not huge on the chorus. It could be better",11/10 Silly choreo,,,
My House,a bit of an odd track,"Amazing chorus would be higher if mv is included, so pretty.",that choreography tho,,,,No mine,"That baby voice sucks, get rid of it.",You can take me to your house anytime ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),,"Sounds like something JYP wanted to sing, but just gave to 2pm instead.",,,Pretty catchy,11/10 Heterochromatic Taecyeon,,"This was my first 2PM video, and one of the first non BTS videos I saw.

Total,"i dont even have much of an opinion, i like a couple of track here and there but mostly it's just ""alright"" and ""meh"" also jay park idol LMFAO","I don't know for sure who it is, possibly Chansung, but there is one person in this group who makes it sound like JYP is in the group and it always makes me uncomfortable.",your songs suck but keep on laying that pipe my dudes,,I didnt know much about them before this rate other than ADTOY. But they never really had that song that blew me away. Mostly just offensively bad vocals and production mixed with questionable choreo.,,,"2PM have got the looks, but only a couple bangers (songs) (also giggity), I think of them as having lots of party songs. Cabi song is 11 Out of 10.",,"Very dated like Wonder Girls, but liked their songs a little bit better overall.","If you weren't in the fandom at the time, I don't think you realize just how huge they were. Like they were everywhere. I don't think JYP knows what to do with idols once they are past like 24.","2pm definitely had their moment and you had to be there for it, because a lot of their music did not age well.","kind of surprised at how short their discography seems to bee over all, JYP back in the day didn't have their groups release a ton of music I guess, that definitely changed in the 3rd gen. I had a harder time getting into them cause of their singing but now I like their songs a lot more.","I know I meme’d that I didn’t like this group but honestly they had some pretty good songs. But they had no songs that really blew me away. One gripe I had were their vocals which were boring at times, there were vocal runs that sounded a bit weird like ‘was that really the best take?’ was my reaction at times, and there was some bad falsetto.",11/10 muscles,Nothing by them really stands out to me at all... just kinda bland. Stray Kids covering their songs always make me happy though for some reason lmao,Is their concept just getting into girls' pants?,I've never really been into 2pm. There's nothing awful about there music and they do have some gem it's just that most is mediocre
Beast/Highlight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bad Girl,:chuufist:,Did they have no faith in their vocals from the start? The autotune is terrible. Junhyung is the only saving grace here.,dance break part is trash,,bad debut,,,bad: autotune.

Shock,wait this isn't f(x),"I didn't know this was their first comeback, legendary!",o dis a banger,,iconic lyrics,,this song is about beating their dicks,"nice bridge, liked the temporary drop out then right back into it.

I'm probably the only person that remembers those lol.",The one song I actually really enjoy by this group,party song,"This is actually a beast song I have listened to regularly in the past, it’s a banger",11/10 skateboard and bike tricks,Hearing this live CHANGES YOU.,,
Shadow,wait this isnt f(x),"Wasn't good, wasn't bad. I wish Junhyung could of just rapped through it all.",,,,,because i am shadow,"Nice progression, Melody during chorus is ++",,,,,Awesome followup,This song is okay 3edgy5me,11/10 too spooky,,,
Good Luck,another aight song,"This song does nothing but make me happy, in a twisted was. Yoseob's vocals from the first second & Junhyung's verse. The sass in this song is amazing. (Was a possible 11 candidate)",,,,,https://i.imgur.com/fBVKLjp.png,I'd like my 4 minutes back.,,,,,great!,69 lol,11/10 Vegas and Route 66 signs next to Chinese signs,,,Their best song
12:30,members shine on this,Good typical emotional comeback.,not a banger,,,,,It's like a sad dance track. Bass+drums are far too hard majority of the song.,,,,,but seriously who is the tattooed drummer,Pretty great vocals,11/10 shirtless drummer,,The drum is really distracting,
Gotta Go to Work,w-what?,Still don't like cute Beast & Junhyung still saved it.,they need to stay in their lane and this aint it,,,,,Huge appreciation for the space created by the bass,,,,I never want to hear this song again,This song is super cute,Cute,11/10 Overly controlling SO's and unhealthy relationships,,,"Their worst most forgettable, most mediocre, most lifeless song"
YeY,NeY,Gives me BigBang vibes & I don't know why the music is far too loud at the chorus.,,,,,YEET,"There's something weird in how the synth falls off in the chorus, it sounds terrible and half assed",,,,,not feeling it,Pretty hype,11/10 dancing in a weed farm,,It's very Big Bang wanna be,
Butterfly,wait this isn't go won,This was absolutely beautiful.,,,,,dogshit,For a ballad I guess it's ok. I liked the secondary layer of ad libs,,,,a ballad,wow that was really pleasant,It's a ballad,11/10 sentimental blank stares,,"Eh, it's a really nice ballad",
Ribbon,i kinda forgot about it and i just listened to it,Not bad but that electric violin thing pained my ears so much.,,,,,,I guess it's a lot better than butterfly so there is that.,,,,,What a way to end their time as Beast,Not bad but nothing special about this song for me,11/10 strings,,rip beast,Beast should have gone out with a better song. not bad just forgettable
Plz Don't Be Sad,"im really annoyed that it says ""plz""",Loved this before kcon loved it even more after kcon because of how much fun they have with it.,,,,,kcon ny 2017 hype song,"sweeping filters sell the breaks, this is a tasteful main synth line and it's mixed really nice",,,,I really enjoy this song,Nice beginning as Highlight,"I grew to love this I don’t know what happened, it’s a banger",11/10 debut song,B O P,,
Calling You,putp,So these lyrics are my whole last 5 years.,,,,,,"Love the muted feeling of the snare and kick, with elongated crash cymbols. Acoustic outro good",,,Why does someone here sound like GD?,,,Decent,11/10 Jeep referees?????,,,
Can Be Better,yeah it probably could,Since becoming Highlight their lyrics are outstanding.,,,,,,I feel like they tried to copy the synth from pls don't be sad and it just sucks here,,,,this song can literally be better,,Banger,11/10 phallic imagery,EvEN BIGGER BOP,It sounds like it's trying to be Plz Don't Be Sad,
Total,"my overall thoughts are kinda a lack of thought to be honest, like i probably would listen to a lot of it again but on first impression the songs arent that memorable and this group is a light 6",Beast=Saved by Junhyung Highlight=AMAZING lyrics & Junhyung,better than i expected,,This is a 7 out of 10 group,,"beast was trash, their stint as Highlight has been very good","I prefer the content from their rebrand, another artist mis-managed by cube? No surprise",,"Probably the most disappointing group, voted for them cause I thought they had a lot of good songs, but other than the ones I already knew, it was pretty bad.","This was always a group that had hits, but I never actually stanned. I only listened to the music, so when I got back into kpop I was so confused to learn that they are now highlight.",I am not a fan,"Yeah I have not been paying as much attention to what they've been doing, but yeah Their songs polarized me. Their early songs were eeeeeehhhh kinda not good but they got better with age.","Really great vocals, and some bangers. Not too many duds",11/10 at leaving their company and surviving,"I thought I saw Loved on the first page but there’s no option here... I’d give it a 10 if it was here Even though I ranked some of their stuff low, their music has a special thing that others don’t have and every song I listen to I don’t hate which is really nice, plus half the song so I really enjoy","I thought I was gonna hate them after hearing their debut, but overall they were a pretty ok group. Also Yoseob will forever look 12.","I liked a decent amount of beast, they were kind of hit and miss for me. I've enjoyed their stuff as highlight more."

She's Back,sick mate,The long notes are what gave this points. There is a reason no one brings up this song.,,,,,kick her out,"I liked the ""she's back"" part after the key change",,,,The emotion I get from this song is probably similar to dog's when their owner gets home from work,,"Cute song, I really love the “ onda-onda-onda” (I thought they were saying “down down down” but apparently not, this is SHINee view all over again rip)",11/10 PUPPIES,,,

Back,"super strong all around, really cohesive",Live version of this is outstanding!,not dope,,,,,"some of the phrases were a bit short in the chorus, they could have elongated more so it doesn't sound like thy are cutting everything off?",,,,this is the moody version of the Chaser,that piano in the beginning sealed it for me,Now this is epic,11/10 best drop in K-Pop,This has always been one of my favorite songs along with the mv,,
Bad,a big fan of this 1,My first Infinite song & it is amazing but I still can't accept that they say bet in between all the bads.,,,,,good mj cover,"Nice punch to it, can't say I like all of the distorted voice parts tho",,,,trap+Infinite= lit af,so bad bad bad girl,This is epic and edgy,11/10 intense string line,Truly THE song,fuck :clap: this :clap: only :clap: one :clap: 11 :clap: rule,
The Eye,the chorus is probably the standout here,I have a soft spot for the weird talking parts.,,,,,,synth violin track was all over the place but in a good way.,,,,,This proves that you don't always need rap parts in songs yall,No actually this is epic and edgy,"11/10 ""WHY DID YOU STOP THE MUSIC""",OKaY oKaY,Infinite has too many good songs... One might say there are... *infinitely* many,
Tell Me,i really like this direction sonically for infinite,"Yet again, chorus!",,,,,bad wonder girls cover,Meh chorus,,This is so boring compared to their older songs.,,this sound like a contemporary christian song,its weird not hearing Hoya,"Actually I was wrong before, this is epic",11/10 Sunkyu's voice,I miSS THEM THIS WAS SO GOOD )):,"""I love you in my mind"" accurately describes my relationship with Sungkyu",
Total,"i feel like i liked them a lot more than i remember doing, some of their stuff is pre average and they dont really have a ""wow"" song but i like a majority of their music",Sungjong is the prettiest human on this planet.,pretty consistently good,"Surprisingly, I liked more of their title tracks compared to SHINee",best 2nd gen group honestly,,"I could listen to the instrumentals on their own, they're pretty good.","I might be a normie for only really liking the chaser, and I'm fine with that. Infinite never caught my attention",,"Knew they had some great songs, but didn't know they had this many. And if I had heard their music before SHINee's, maybe they would've been my favorite group, at least if their album tracks are as good as these songs, and now I really wanna check them out.",Why have I been sleeping on infinite? They are really good.,I think Shinee are the best live performers in kpop. Infinite is the only group that comes close in my eyes,Another group I absolutely loved when I started out in kpop. Its a shame no one ever really talks about them anymore cause they had some amazing songs,"I didn’t give this group a 10 which is a shame, but I like them",11/10 Best Instrumental Tracks in K-Pop,"Infinite will always be one of the best kpop groups that everyone overlooks and I’ll forever be pissed about it, they deserve MORE YOU COWARDS . STAN.",Wow I think I'm lowkey an Inspirit now. I had no idea Infinite was this amazing. Time to check out their albums. But now I feel like a lame math nerd if my two favorite 2nd gen groups are f(x) and infinite....,Infinite is one of my top 5 favorite groups. They have no bad songs. They have grown and evolved while still keeping the infinite feel in their music
