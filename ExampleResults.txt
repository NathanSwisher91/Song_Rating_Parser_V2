**Barron (4):** "i actually dig the metal but the rapping is garbage"
**Jade (4):** "The intro feels straight out of an early step up movie. The guitar is cool. It takes way too long to get to the vocals. I really like the guitar in the background. Rap is really fast but sometimes also feels weird at times too. The instrumental/dance break needs to go though, there is already enough of an intro at the start without singing. That really brings down the songs score. Violin and guitar at the same time sounds like they didnt know what to do so they put them together, it sounds busy there."

Comments
**Lynne (8.27):** "kind of surprised at how short their discography seems to bee over all, JYP back in the day didn't have their groups release a ton of music I guess, that definitely changed in the 3rd gen. I had a harder time getting into them cause of their singing but now I like their songs a lot more."
**Nate (8.0):** "11/10 muscles"
**Sammi (7.55):** "I've never really been into 2pm. There's nothing awful about there music and they do have some gem it's just that most is mediocre"
**FlixerDK (7.36):** "Very dated like Wonder Girls, but liked their songs a little bit better overall."
**Dubi (6.55):** ""
**Fleur (6.45):** ""
**Jade (6.36):** "If you weren't in the fandom at the time, I don't think you realize just how huge they were. Like they were everywhere. I don't think JYP knows what to do with idols once they are past like 24."
**Aubrey (6.18):** "I don't know for sure who it is, possibly Chansung, but there is one person in this group who makes it sound like JYP is in the group and it always makes me uncomfortable."
**Joccarri (6.09):** "2pm definitely had their moment and you had to be there for it, because a lot of their music did not age well."
**aidan (5.91):** "i dont even have much of an opinion, i like a couple of track here and there but mostly it's just "alright" and "meh" also jay park idol LMFAO"
**Eye Smile (5.64):** "2PM have got the looks, but only a couple bangers (songs) (also giggity), I think of them as having lots of party songs. Cabi song is 11 Out of 10."
**Marlon (5.55):** "I know I meme’d that I didn’t like this group but honestly they had some pretty good songs. But they had no songs that really blew me away. One gripe I had were their vocals which were boring at times, there were vocal runs that sounded a bit weird like ‘was that really the best take?’ was my reaction at times, and there was some bad falsetto."
**claudia (5.18):** ""
**Cooper (5.18):** "I didnt know much about them before this rate other than ADTOY. But they never really had that song that blew me away. Mostly just offensively bad vocals and production mixed with questionable choreo."
**Egg (4.91):** ""
**Paige (4.91):** "Nothing by them really stands out to me at all... just kinda bland. Stray Kids covering their songs always make me happy though for some reason lmao"

Comments
**Sammi (8.38):** "Super Junior is an amazing group that has been able to adapt throughout there time in kpop and they have been able to put out quality. Super junior is one of my favorite SM for that"
**Nate (8.19):** "11/10 iconic songs and hair"
**Lynne (8.1):** "UM wow I like their songs more than I thought, they were the first male kpop group I discovered so I guess that could be it. I'm glad that their sound has matured well with age and I hope they continue to take on Latin America and South America by storm."
**Aubrey (7.29):** "Super Junior can do the cheesiest of things and can still make it great...just not Marry U, never Marry U!"
**Jade (7.1):** "I love them. I may not like all the members or even know all their names/faces but I love them. Their songs have been consistant bangers since 2011. Even if they arent artistically great, you can always dance/sing to them. Also Heechul is the best."
**FlixerDK (6.57):** "Suju is very mixed, some really bad, boring and dated songs, and some really good ones."
**Cooper (6.29):** "Some pretty terrible songs in here. Their recent stuff is mostly good though."
**Fleur (6.24):** ""
**claudia (6.1):** "Not as good as SHINee"
**Dubi (6.1):** ""
**Joccarri (6.05):** "One of my top 5 boy groups. More than their music I love their genuine friendship."
**Eye Smile (6.0):** "Super junior has a shit ton of songs, and some of them are great/iconic but some of them suck. I'm more into their later sound. Still a legendary group that somehow made it through 50 different controversies"
**Egg (5.95):** "Rough start, but their mid to later title tracks were very good (apart from Otra Vez)"
**Sam (5.95):** "Did people actually think they were cool?"
**Marlon (5.1):** "Early super junior was wack, I was surprised by how much I liked Devil and Magic"
**Paige (4.86):** "They’re the classic 2nd gen group who so many people look up to, so despite cringey old stuff, they outsold with a good amount of their music that’s the tea 💅🏻"
**Barron (4.71):** "meh"
**aidan (2.76):** "to use a super smash bros analogy here: i feel like i was being constantly knocked off stage again and again, but still coming back for no apparent reason, and then i finally landed, and it was this magnificent landing, and just as i was about to do something i'm thrown off the stage once again and dunked even harder than i was at all throughout the game"

**claudia (8.12):** ""
**Sammi (7.88):** "I liked a decent amount of beast, they were kind of hit and miss for me. I've enjoyed their stuff as highlight more."
**Nate (7.69):** "11/10 at leaving their company and surviving"
**Lynne (7.5):** "Yeah I have not been paying as much attention to what they've been doing, but yeah Their songs polarized me. Their early songs were eeeeeehhhh kinda not good but they got better with age."
**Cooper (7.31):** "This is a 7 out of 10 group"
**Jade (7.31):** "This was always a group that had hits, but I never actually stanned. I only listened to the music, so when I got back into kpop I was so confused to learn that they are now highlight."
**Paige (6.56):** "I thought I saw Loved on the first page but there’s no option here... I’d give it a 10 if it was here Even though I ranked some of their stuff low, their music has a special thing that others don’t have and every song I listen to I don’t hate which is really nice, plus half the song so I really enjoy"
**FlixerDK (6.5):** "Probably the most disappointing group, voted for them cause I thought they had a lot of good songs, but other than the ones I already knew, it was pretty bad."
**Aubrey (6.25):** "Beast=Saved by Junhyung Highlight=AMAZING lyrics & Junhyung"
**Sam (6.25):** "I thought I was gonna hate them after hearing their debut, but overall they were a pretty ok group. Also Yoseob will forever look 12."
**Marlon (6.0):** "Really great vocals, and some bangers. Not too many duds"
**Dubi (5.94):** ""

**Sam (8.05):** "Big Bang was the first 2nd gen group I really got into.

Big Bang is a group I desperately wanna see live someday. Their concerts are amazing!"

**Lynne (9.42):** "The first boy group I fell in love with, their 3rd album made me stay for the long haul in kpop and Lucifer was my most played song for the longest time. I still feel sad about Jonghyun dying but Im glad that they are moving on in their lives"
**Sam (8.79):** "SHINee is the greatest kpop group to ever exist. I wish I had gotten into kpop earlier so I could've seen ot5 live. I'm glad to see them continuing on after losing Jonghyun, even though it's not the same."
**claudia (8.74):** "I will forever be a shawol <3"

**Cooper (8.47):** "one of the best discographies in kpop yeet"

**Aubrey (8.11):** "SHINee is one of my top groups for a reason, they RARELY disappoint."
**Egg (7.89):** "Strong discography holy shit. Apart from some blips, this is the most 10s I've given"

**Dubi (7.32):** ""
**Marlon (7.05):** "Growing up primarily focusing on girl groups, SHINee were one of the exceptions as I was there for every comeback. I especially love the solo work of the members. I sincerely apologise for giving my 0 to ring ding dong but it had to be done. Anyways shout outs to Obama. Peace."
**Eye Smile (7.0):** "If I was female or gay I'd probably stan SHINee and no one else. They are a gold mine of great songs, singles, side tracks, japanese stuff.. It's all good. How they weren't bigger.. I'm baffled. Thanks Obama for the shout out."
**aidan (6.89):** "shinee is a supreme vocal group, and i feel like a lot of sm's best production went to them, i really like how they evolved as time went on and while i dont like EVERY song i feel like they were pretty consistent for each era"
**Fleur (6.42):** ""
**Barron (6.05):** "great vocals"
