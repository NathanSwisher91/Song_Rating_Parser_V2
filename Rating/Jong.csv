Royal Pirates,Overall,9,I surprisingly enjoyed this group a lot (surprising because a lot of others seemed to shit on them). Looking forward to checking out more from them later. ,,
Day6,Congratulations,10,"One of the best debuts I've heard. Yes I am very biased. This is the perfect intro to Day6 as a group, song is a banger and the lyrics tell a sad story. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3sFsHrUyLQ&ab_channel=JYPEntertainment,
Day6,Letting Go,10,"I love the melody in this song, and the vocals are fantastic. Sungjin kills the prechorus. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-1TGNmQqZA&ab_channel=JYPEntertainment,

Day6,You Were Beautiful,10,"Wonpil owns this song, emotional chorus suits his voice so well.  I also love the ELO style harmonic ad libs thrown in there. One of their most popular songs for a reason.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS7tz2rAOSA&ab_channel=JYPEntertainment,
Day6,How Can I Say,10,"Classic hype song that is perfect for concerts. I love the verses in this, really great way to slow it down inbetween the hype choruses. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwywhL1PenQ&ab_channel=JYPEntertainment,

Day6,What Can I Do,10,"Love love love the dirty guitar in this. Almost has an anti-drop chorus, you expect something harder and it gives you a slow vibey chorus with great harmonies. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RJWqIEo_Tc&ab_channel=JYPEntertainment,
Day6,I Loved You,10,"One of their better ballads, part of their mini MV series they did. Sungjin is so good on the chorus. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwLMA5XYnKI&ab_channel=JYPEntertainment,
Day6,When You Love Someone,10,"I love the harmonies and adlibs in this song, chorus has a groove to it that is unexpected with this kind of slow ballad-like song. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWQ1xOfUNYQ&ab_channel=JYPEntertainment,

Day6,I Like You,9,"Great band ballad, does get a little repetitive, but the vocals carry it through. Brian and Bob kill it on the chorus. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daoMYJv8i0c&ab_channel=JYPEntertainment,
Day6,Shoot Me,10,"Big banger. Wonpil kills it in this song, great keyboard work + that bridge. Message of the song is also nice. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2X2LdJAIpU&ab_channel=JYPEntertainment,

Day6,Days Gone By,10,"The first Day6 song I heard. I heard it in a KVille new song playlist back in late 2018 when I was getting into Kpop. One of the more interesting songs I heard at the time, with strong 80s theme in the song and the MV. It was my best decision to dive into more of their music!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nk5O__ALI8&ab_channel=JYPEntertainment,
Day6,Time of Our Life,10,This is the perfect concert song. Full of energy and great to single along to. Happy Day6 is so much fun. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnS_jn2uibs&ab_channel=JYPEntertainment,
Day6,Sweet Chaos,10,This was a great follow up to Time of Our Life and another great concert song. I love the jazzy trill piano in the chorus. I also love the colour fade in effects in the MV. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWUGikRxGQs&ab_channel=JYPEntertainment,
Day6,Zombie,10,The Lockdown song. Sad that this was their last song before a year long hiatus. But it is so good. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8gx-C7GCGU&ab_channel=JYPEntertainment,
Day6,Overall,10,"This should be surprising no one. Day6 are my favourite group when it comes to music alone. I genuinely have dozens of plays for every one of these songs, some of them over 100. They are close to being my most listened to group. It's sad that it looks like things are stopping for the group, with enlistments coming up, and one of my biggest regrest will be not making it to see them in Jan 2020 as it looks like I'll never be able to see them live now. RIP. However, we still have a 5 member comeback in April coming up that I am really looking forward to, so hoping to go out with a bang!",,

N.Flying,Spring Memories,10,One of my favourite N flying songs. The build up to the chorus resolves well and the song is elevated with Hweseung's vocals. The bridge is sooo good. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK0mQUIktWU&ab_channel=1theK%28%EC%9B%90%EB%8D%94%EC%BC%80%EC%9D%B4%29,

N.Flying,Starlight,9,"Sad MV, would probs work well as an OST if they weren't all about ballads. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2bjShbdb4U&ab_channel=FNCEnt,
N.Flying,Overall,9,NGL Hweseung hard carries this group. I love his voice and he adds so much to their sound. ,,
ONEWE,"Butterfly, Find a Flower",10,Oh boy that sax and smooth vocals to start had me sold in the first 30 seconds. They debuted with their best song. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2GEyzXGBaI&ab_channel=MAKEASUB,

ONEWE,Reminisce About All,9,Love the piano start with just vocals and then all the instruments fill in as it builds towards the end. Really nice pay off with the vocals at the end. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCAETENi07I&ab_channel=StoneMusicEntertainment,

ONEWE,Regulus,5,"The autotune ruins this. No need for it in this kind of song. Apart from that, vocals are nice on the chorus, and it does the soft ballad style well. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwH_IbaICHI&ab_channel=StoneMusicEntertainment,
ONEWE,Q,5,"Hwasa can't save this, this just isn't my style of song from a band",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww0O3RhZbXw&ab_channel=StoneMusicEntertainment,
ONEWE,End of Spring,10,It's like they did the instrumental for the SF9 song (I know it's standard western sound but still). I really like this sound from them.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEX1uzPK6kw&ab_channel=StoneMusicEntertainment,
ONEWE,Parting,7,Snooze. Guitar solo saved this by making it more interesting towards the end. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnnNqYknix8&ab_channel=1theK%28%EC%9B%90%EB%8D%94%EC%BC%80%EC%9D%B4%29,

ONEWE,Overall,7,"A bit hit or miss for me, but when they do hit, they hit really well. Might need to check out more of their stuff to find the other hits. (Also caveat that some of these scores have been lowered due to some band fatigue on the watch2gethers)",,
Honeyst,Perfume,8,This is a bop. Nice energy to the song and a catchy chorus melody.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_VAMSz25gc&ab_channel=FNCNEOZSCHOOL%28FNC%EB%84%A4%EC%98%A4%EC%A6%88%EC%8A%A4%EC%BF%A8%29,

IZ,Overall,7,"It's a shame this group is so polarizing with their releasing, sometimes I love it, other times I really don't like it. I'll happily grab the songs I love though.",,
Marmello,Puppet,8,"Not sold on the ""Puppet Puppet Pow"" hook, but the rest is nice. Instrumentals are a stand out in this one, really like the guitar solo. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJjIQP56CxU&ab_channel=GENIEMUSIC,

Marmello,Overall,8,"Pretty solid in the end. I wasn't sold immediately, but they are quite good. I'm assuming they have disbanded now, which is a shame. But hopefully we get more girl bands in the future (like Rolling Quartz).",,

Rockit Girl,Overall,1,Worst group I've rated. If they haven't already I hope they disband and never sing again. ,,
The East Light,Holla,3,Those wigs were certainly a choice. Sadly they can't sing very well so this song is mostly cringe. Got to give them props for their instrumental work though,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3L6xB9i7JU&ab_channel=TheEastLight.,

The East Light,Are You Okay,5,":hwasa_oof: . Some nice parts here, but overall pretty weak. Also really unfortunate title. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPmEuMjDdb0&ab_channel=TheEastLight.TheEastLight.Verified,

LED Apple,Birthday Killer,8,1st song I've heard from them when they sound like an actual band and not just a boy group with an instrument gimmick. I like this. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBiiULw1UrM&ab_channel=yumaiysub,
LED Apple,Time Is Up,6,"2nd gen boy group given instruments. Not that bad though, just not something that really pulls me in. I also don't like rapping in bands. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MfvdFY253Q&ab_channel=1theK%28%EC%9B%90%EB%8D%94%EC%BC%80%EC%9D%B4%29,

LED Apple,Run to You,7,2nd gen boy group given instruments. I like the vibe in this song. The back and forth on the vocals work nicely. Rap brings it down though.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNiLSb2_kL0&ab_channel=1theK%28%EC%9B%90%EB%8D%94%EC%BC%80%EC%9D%B4%29,
