2NE1,Fire,10,"One of K-pop's most iconic debuts ever from the original Monster Rookies, this song really stands the test of time. ""Independent Women"" style songs in K-pop are often great because songwriters wisely opt for stronger backings, and the backings also carry this song forward.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISEoXdHb4W4,
2NE1,I Don't Care,8,"2NE1 hit gold early in their career, like this song.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MgAxMO1KD0,
2NE1,Clap Your Hands,8,"To Anyone is one of my favorite K-pop albums ever, and it's because of songs like this. I don't really have a choice, I'm compelled to clap my hands while listening to this song.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTw-UM5Jy4E,
2NE1,Go Away,8,"Another single from ""To Anyone"", ""Go Away"" really demonstrates the kind of infectious and fun pop songwriting that was YG's trademark... Until they threw it away for sonic trend dickriding. This was also THE SHIT live.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yW13T2sfKg,
2NE1,Can't Nobody,9,"Another single off of ""To Anyone"", this song just FUCKING BANGS. Don't pretend the ""I'm so bad, I'm so bad, but I'm so good, so good"", ""Can't nobody hold us down"", ""Let's rock, just take it to the top, ain't never gonna stop"" hooks aren't catchy as ALL FUCK.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihi_kJJj_8A,
2NE1,It Hurts,4,"One of the few misses in ""To Anyone"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUiMaz4BNKw,
2NE1,Lonely,10,"Much like MBK, YG also had their own brand of ballad songwriting, and this one honestly is probably their best.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n4V3lGEyG4,
2NE1,I Am The Best,10,"Their most iconic song, and while it may not be the best, it still FUCKING BANGS. That riff is so ball-smacking it turns men into eunuchs. Still one of K-pop's best party starters, a decade into its release.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7_lSP8Vc3o,
2NE1,Hate You,10,"My favorite 2NE1 song, there's so much that can go wrong in a song without any instrumental breaks, but because the songwriters are awesome, they added catchy melodies after catchy melodies after catchy melodies and the song is a sheer fucking earworm from start to finish.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB5jyYD2WEw,
2NE1,Ugly,10,"A great YG style pop-rock song, and very heartfelt lyrics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGe0hHvAGkc,
2NE1,I Love You,9,"It's not 2NE1's best track from 2012, that would be ""Ugly"" and the Japanese release ""Scream"", but it still fucking bangs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUrUPzLm5SI,
2NE1,Falling In Love,8,"Nobody expected, or wanted for that matter, 2NE1 to release a reggae-lite single to follow their 2012 releases, but the song is a fucking banger so now everyone is fine with it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEVd9pSG85Q,
2NE1,Do You Love Me,1,"A throwback to their ""To Anyone"" sound, but if the songwriters forgot to write good songs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRTb81FpWq0,
2NE1,Missing You,1,"Builds up to something great, then goes ballad in the chorus. It's just like having sex, and just as you're getting there, you suddenly get a call from your mum asking you to buy soy sauce before you go home, then she hears your partner's breathing then suddenly accuses you of ""not being the child I brought up"" and saying ""kids these days grow up so fast and leave their parents early"" and then of course your partner hears that and suddenly everything becomes awkward and your libido dies down and won't recover for 2 whole years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG0jlKdB1s0,
2NE1,Come Back Home,5,"2NE1 went full YOLO with this release, with YG's brand new sonic trend dickriding approach to songwriting, and they forgot everything good about 2NE1's back catalogue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLbfv-AAyvQ,
2NE1,Gotta Be You,3,"A hodge-podge of unfinished musical ideas, seriously, CL's part is a different song - a pedestrian trap section with a horrifying harmonica, Dara's is a boring build-up, while Bom's and Minzy's parts are the only sections with an actual semi-coherent idea, but on it's own, the generic Disco beat and rehashed early-YG style melodies isn't enough to carry a whole song, especially something as disjointed as this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdKTgwffmdo,
2NE1,Goodbye,3,"Look, I love 2NE1 as much as the next person, but bullshit lazy ballads are never a good way to say goodbye. Would've been infinitely better if they did ""I Am The Best"" 2.0 or ""Fire"" 2.0.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEkLHC7l25w,
2NE1,Overall,9,"One of my favorite girl groups ever, 2NE1 were pretty much unstoppable during their peak from 2009-2012. and while sadly we didn't get as much songs from that time as we wanted, and they slowed down starting 2013, their back catalogue is still honestly pretty fucking solid. Not to mention they're quite easily the best K-pop girl group live show I've seen ever - ""Nolza"" and ""Now Or Never"" are some of the best K-pop concerts I'd ever been in, right up there with BigBang and BTS shows. 2NE1 just had charisma to burn, and despite the fact that their ""Independent Women"" persona is a corporate product (as is everything in a glamour industry), I still got caught in it and I thorougly enjoyed the girl crush experience.",,
4Minute,Hot Issue,5,"Pretty decent as far as debuts go, but certainly far from 4Minute's best.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPPKwg5eQ4o,
4Minute,Muzik,4,A decent chorus saves this otherwise bad song.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNYImwBU4f4,
4Minute,What A Girl Wants,6,"Far from the best ""cute"" 4Minute song, please refer to ""Heart To Heart"". That being said, this isn't all that bad.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f07vXjZkfjk,
4Minute,Jingle Jingle,3,Childish.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI3P0ATq97U,

4Minute,I My Me Mine,7,Banger!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGvwy3qhjDM,
4Minute,Heart to Heart,10,"My favorite 4Minute song and K-pop's best ever karaoke song, if you don't believe me, watch it live.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h97jt1XtnGQ,
4Minute,Mirror MIrror,4,The chorus is a bit of a turn off and doesn't reward the great build-up with a good payoff.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fOG_wcV_oU,
4Minute,Volume Up,10,"Very accurate song title, this subwoofer wrecker gets louder as it goes and explodes into a very banging chorus. The visuals in this era are also to die for.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsWl1--Niyg,
4Minute,Over and Over,9,I remember the days when I listened to this great song over and over.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2ANhvjbGyA,
4Minute,What's Your Name?,1,"Disaster. This is basically an infinitely worse take on Hyuna's ""Ice Cream"" with awful synthesizers and bullshit blues-scale melodies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-IJWqIHioA,
4Minute,Is It Poppin'?,2,"I mean at least it's better than their other 2013 song ""What's Your Name?"", but it's not like it was difficult to top that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRSRpXPZVdM,
4Minute,Watcha Doin' Today,1,What's Your Name? version 2.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74Pru-JQzRk,
4Minute,Thank You,2,Boring ballad for the fans.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WGDBzBzqKM,
4Minute,Cold Rain,2,Ballads are not what I signed up for when listening to 4Minute.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT9zbZGB2gE,
4Minute,Crazy,10,"Because 2NE1 weren't doing shit, 4Minute muscled in on their old territory with this phyrgian scale yoloswag banger that is actually better than most of 2NE1's later material because the songwriters didn't forget to add an actual ball-smacking beat.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nCLBTmjJBY,
4Minute,Hate You,6,"HOLY SHIT THAT DROP WAS AMAZING!!! okay, let's not get our panties in a bunch.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_F9HUTYnl0,
4Minute,Overall,8,"Love these ladies. A group more closely associated to 2NE1 than SNSD, most people forget that 4Minute weren't all YOLO and had a very varied discography full of smooth, easy-listening gems like ""Heart To Heart"". Although of course their bad bitch image isn't unwarranted and they have great bomb-ass songs too. Also, I can't stress this enough, but 4Minute was weaponised by the South Korean government against North Korea, if that doesn't scream ""Queen Shit Only"", I don't know what would.",,
APink,I Don't Know,7,"Apink, and well many a girl group, has SNSD to thank for their careers, and songs like this, while not really quite up there, is still a passable copy of that early SNSD sound.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI6MvzIZ3CA,
APink,My My,6,"More early SNSD, not as good as their debut, but still decent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA9niwM2r9Q,
APink,Hush,6,"Instead of SNSD, they take a stab at T-ara this time, and the result is somewhat alright.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXZ19CvCmto,
APink,NoNoNo,10,"Great ""innocent"" concept, also a great song.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hspqQuuuGIw,
APink,Good Morning Baby,9,"One of their better songs from their ""innocent"" era. The chorus really saves the song.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SshpsY8GILg,
APink,Mr. Chu,7,"I really shouldn't like this more than I do, but it's just so fucking catchy, man.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5H-GvnNz2Y,
APink,Luv,7,"Pretty good, and yes Eunji, I L.O.V.E. LUV you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dVjSvLzD1I,
APink,Promise U,3,Boring.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzljAKtsOuw,
APink,Remember,7,Much has been said about Apink's musical and thematic transformation but their early sound was still fucking amazing.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXlrqQKbjSM,
APink,The Wave,8,Good lighter-waving pop-rock song.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXvCNLTWwB0,
APink,Only One,7,Melody is lacking a bit of that oomph.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCSFdRf0210,
APink,Cause You're My Star,7,Verses are pedestrian but it's redeemed by a great chorus.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-r5ULxo4WD0,
APink,Always,4,Boring.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hz_eJmj7E,
APink,Five,8,Not Apink's best but still pretty nice.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b22Ed7f0D-0,
APink,Miracle,3,Boring ballad for the fans.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fihius0K9B0,
APink,I'm So Sick,10,"Very Apink, and very good. Lots of people say it was the ""conceptual"" change that Apink finally got, but while that may have been true from a visuals perspective, the music is as Apink as Apink can get. And that's good.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4oHuML9U2A,
APink,%% (Eung Eung),10,"This song is unique. It's weird. And it's fucking amazing. An 80s throwback but not really, instead cleverly borrowing 80s textures but marries it everything else not 80s to create a song that is truly one of a kind.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=499YUeNoYVE,
APink,Dumhdurum,10,"Apink are fucking amazing. They are now 3/3 in their new sound and ""Dumhdurum"" is a bit like the first two combined, a bit closer texturally and musically to ""I'm So Sick"", but is similar to ""%%"" structurally, and is better than the two songs. What's super great about this song is it improves upon the only thing that I pointed out a *very slight weakness* in ""%%"" which is that the actual chorus melody is a bit weak, with both songs the actual stars of the show are the riffs, but in ""Dumhdurum"", they have a chorus section that doesn't just act as a prelude to the riff, but the actual chorus also fucking bangs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqzTRK5GPWQ,
APink,Overall,8,"I love Apink, I think they're one of the better SNSD copies (obviously GFriend is the best ehem), but like GFriend, they certainly put their own brand to that early SNSD sound, and I really love their brand of music. That being said, their transformation circa 2018 is one of K-pop's best ever concept changes and so far it has brought us three outstanding title tracks, their ""trilogy"" are all all-time faves, and I'm genuinely excited for their second prime.",,
f(x),La Cha Ta,4,"f(x) certainly didn't start out strong, with a very generic and very boring single for their debut. I blame SM for this, as is the case for every problem in the world, blame SM.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7MHZpSNJQc,
f(x),Chu~,6,This was better than their debut but still falls flat compared to their best songs.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cnz2n5VcV4Q,
f(x),Nu ABO,10,It's just one sound effect after the other but goddamn does it work wonders. This song set the standard for the SM style production that their newer groups use.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8ZrPFMr_nY,
f(x),Pinocchio (Danger),10,"f(x) was really the poster kid of experimentation in K-pop, and due in large part to songs like this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKS12iGFyEA,
f(x),Hot Summer,10,"Not only copies the original ""Hot Summer"", which was already a good song, wholesale, but also manages to make it A LOT better, SM really outdid themselves here. f(x) really can do both pseudo-experimental and pure pop, top group shit only.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-rftpZ7kCY,
f(x),Electric Shock,10,"No chord changes, no problem.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8I8QGFA1oM,
f(x),Rum Pum Pum Pum,10,"Not the best song in ""Pink Tape"", which says a lot about the album, this song is still some amazing shit. A pop song without any chord progression, yet still heavily driven by songwriting, it's something really special.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnku4o3tRB4,
f(x),Red Light,10,"Red Light is, for a long time, and probably still is, the most forward-thinking song in kpop, eschewing most kpop sensibilities for something truly special, the meat and potatoes of the song are in the rhythm section, with an amazing beat combining trap and metal elements in the rhythms, but not necessarily being either of the two. The song could honestly work with that alone but the topline is also some catchy shit. This song remains one of K-pop's best dark concepts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv-8-EgPEY0,
f(x),4Walls,6,"SHINee's View but somewhat inferior, f(x) became generic when Sulli left, thankfully the album still rocks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j7Umwfx60Q,
f(x),All Mine,6,f(x) really lost all their f(x)-ness when Sulli left and were stuck to decent SHINee songs.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0S3knWIdrY,
f(x),Overall,10,"One of K-pop's best groups from a musical and conceptual standpoint, and certainly one of my all-time favorites as well, f(x) was really top-tier. They started slow, but when they got it going, I could count in one hand the amount of groups who can match the quality of their output, but honestly, f(x) is still ahead of the pack. They don't have one, or two, they had THREE great full albums in ""Pink Tape, ""Red Light"", and ""4 Walls"", not many K-pop groups can even make the claim of having ONE good mini album. And maybe it's the drugs talking, but I really vibed and related to their concept, and felt as if they were one of the most relatable groups out there, even when they weren't marketed as your typical idol group. Obviously the individual members are also very relatable, especially my bias Sulli... and now I'm crying, and rambling, but yes.",,
Kara,Break it,4,Mid 2000s R&B reminiscent of Beyonce.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NIYJ8A5R0s,
Kara,If U Wanna,4,Dull R&B.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K7uDzaPsR8,
Kara,Rock U,6,Not very rocking.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqF3qmxv-H8,
Kara,Pretty Girl,7,"Such a meme. If you wanna pretty, every wanna pretty...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35eYHsrNGzc,
Kara,Honey,7,The brisk rhythms carry this otherwise bland song forward.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_AQ7AkVzpM,
Kara,Wanna,10,"Before MINX was reconfigured into every metalhead's wet dream, and also before Blackpink did metal - KARA was *the* metal group, and ""Wanna"" is their best song. ""Wanna"" is a metal song disguising as a pure pop song what with the awesome metal-style pedal point harmonies and amazing keyboard-driven metal riffs. All that and with catchy as fuck melodies on top and great Queen-style harmonies and we have one of the best Kpop songs ever.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24_nW2HILtk,
Kara,Mister,9,"Great catchy pop song, with an addictive and iconic choreo to boot.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VbGuZryssA,
Kara,Lupin,8,Best song named after a criminal.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7TYiyEhxdI,
Kara,Jumping,8,"Not their best, very screechy sometimes, but still rocks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SweXhOQPMdM,
Kara,Step,10,"One of KARA's best songs, a very metal song with an anthemic chorus driven by orgasmic Queen-style harmonies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYoYoBtLqOY,
Kara,Pandora,10,"Probably my 2nd favorite KARA track. Metal riffs, strings, soaring melodies, brisk tempos, this song has it all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0XpNvLWimo,
Kara,Damaged Lady,10,"The most outwardly metal Sweetune got with KARA, it isn't as great as their best material but it does go very hard.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vHw17-zFa4,
Kara,Mamma Mia!,8,Not KARA's best but still rocks.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEAdE9wSqwg,
Kara,Cupid,6,The C-U-P-I-D breakdown is actually cool and lifts up this otherwise generic tune.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74RzHIpZuDY,
Kara,Overall,10,"Still one of my favorite girl groups ever, KARA was the original metal group in K-pop, and the metalhead in me was conveniently able to enjoy metal songs packaged into pop songs sung by attractive women. The group themselves are very inspiring, in more ways than one, and I sorely miss them even to this day. Now I'm crying because I just remembered Hara and how her name rhymes with KARA and how she released ""Midnight Queen"" which sounds just like a KARA song from their peak and it just makes me really sad really.",,
Miss A,Bad Girl Good Girl,10,"The concept is great and all but people often forget the awesome song, with a really cool arrangement, catchy melodies, and that bonkers keyboard in the chorus.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TeeJvcBdLA,
Miss A,Breathe,2,"Tuneless. You can tell even JYP was embarassed of this, opting not to put his signature whisper.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTnwjlDhAY4,
Miss A,Love Alone,7,Not Miss A's best but still gets over the line.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBR0oEUIoGI,
Miss A,Goodbye Baby,10,"Was re-made by JYP himself into ""BDZ"" - and made it better, but this song still rocks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYKO1za5mX0,
Miss A,Touch,10,"My favorite Miss A song and one of K-pop's truly sexy songs, this song is just so fucking smooth. I recommend playing this during foreplay, it will surely enhance your sex life. Tried and tested. Not by me though...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF8Fst_zonU,
Miss A,I Don't Need A Man,10,"A very very unique song sonically and from a songwriting standpoint, in that it uses the Major Pentatonic scale, only one other K-pop song at the top of my head uses the same scale, labelmates TWICE's ""BDZ"". The song just seamlessly grooves, very relaxing to the ear with the cool keyboards, cool melodies, and perfect vocal presentation. The lyrics are also very cool.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkSOOiMDGiY,
Miss A,Hush,3,E-tribe's last hurrah and thankfully so.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp0F18FFCTE,
Miss A,Only You,5,Otherwise average song helped up because I re-played the fuck out of it because Min...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO9RzrhYR-I,
Miss A,Overall,10,"JYP got all his girl groups right, especially those he writes for, because more often than not, we get great songwriting and arrangement on their songs. I really really like Miss A though because they're the card I always play whenever people tell me I have an unjustifiable hate for R&B. I always tell them ""I like R&B when it's good"", and they'd be like ""Oh, yeah? That's like bullshit, you hate on every R&B song ever"", then I'd be like ""Miss A are one of my favorite K-pop groups ever though, and they're R&B. Boom!"" (important to note that I also like the more typical K-R&B like Shannon's ""Hello"" and Eyedi's ""Best Mistake (k)""). Anyways, JYP really got Miss A right and it's a mystery to me why he can't replicate the same amount of success when writing for his boy groups.",,
Sistar,Push Push,4,"Just an awkward ""girl crush"" song.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75y5iN7z-08,
Sistar,Shady Girl,4,The only thing worth of note here is Heechul.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VpLniRbPI8,
Sistar,How Dare You,10,"A very unique K-pop song in terms of structure, a great chorus bookends a song that allows it to start and end really well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1hvB_L30o,
Sistar,So Cool,4,"Bravesound only really hit it right from 2012 onwards, so yeah not this one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3q0ZChgFE,
Sistar,Alone,10,"An astoundingly groovy song, this is still one of Sistar's best songs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0ZHXVp_wUE,
Sistar,Loving U,10,"The ultimate Sistar summer anthem - nice, bright, with great singing, and even rips The Beach Boys off, what's not to like? Sistar looks amazing as usual too.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL2AlXWVbKU,
Sistar,Give It To Me,4,"Pandora at half speed, and half the fun.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6XLNsJ9YrA,
Sistar,Touch My Body,7,"Probably their most popular song, but far from their best. Still pretty decent though.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9txzvu6eQuw,
Sistar,I Swear,1,Unholy earfuck of cluttered brass and shrill vocals.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktEEjk3Xy3s,
Sistar,Shake It,1,"Not even trying anymore, Sistar copies and pastes the melodies of their past hits, and somehow fucking them up still, and just engages in an unholy barrage of shrill vocals. Starship knew they would cash in as long as Sistar releases a summer song, so why even try?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9-TIy7WPQI,
Sistar,I Like That,10,"My favorite Sistar song. A very different song from the usual summer affair, the song is moody and dark, but very punchy and kickass at the same time. With brisk rhythms, sexy textures, and awesome sampled vocals topped off with easily the best chorus in Sistar's discography. Also, Sistar looks great, I mean they always do, but especially moreso in this era.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJVUjmNMF8c,
Sistar,Lonely,4,I don't really fuck with any of these goodbye songs.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbXV2R_Yd1E,
Sistar,Overall,8,"One of K-pop's most iconic groups - their music may not always be my cup of tea, and their image as ""Summer Queens"" may not sit right with me (if only because I didn't like many songs associated with this image), but Sistar still has a pretty solid discography in retrospect. They have all-time faves like ""I Like That"" and ""Loving U"" as well as a bunch of other amazing songs. The Sistar members are also all very fucking attractive women and I just really love them, man.",,
SNSD,Into The New World,10,"NATIONAL ANTHEM. One of the most important songs in K-pop every, and quite possibly the best debut song ever. This is how 90's groups wanted to sound but couldn't, SNSD took that sound and made it infinitely better, this song has everything going for it, starting from that bonkers intro, then my dad opens up, and she not only opens up this song, she also opened up an era. Then we have an amazing chorus, then amazing everything else. Also props for going away from K-pop's usual songwriting (circle-of-fifths and R&B) and using something more fun.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k2Zzkw_-0I,
SNSD,Girls' Generation,10,"Not as memorable as South Korea's National Anthem, and while ""Into The New World"" is a no-brainer 10/10 still, I still believe this oft-forgotten first comeback title is SNSD's best ever. This is actually a cover of that 1989 song of the same name but SNSD puts the original to shame by making a pop song that rocks harder than almost everything else.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbLh4i40I4E,
SNSD,Kissing You,9,Good song but the skool rock version outsold.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3yxxe66LXs,
SNSD,Baby Baby,8,"Not very memorable, but still a pretty good song in retrospect.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0OGl8WzpXM,
SNSD,Gee,10,"E-Tribe's only good song, and regardless of the songs they put out after this, I'm still thankful for them because one, this song is great, and two, they used ""Gee"" money to eventually debut Dreamcatcher. Song has more similarities with Stray Kid's ""Side Effects"" than almost anything else, cleverly using EBM-style backings to offset the cloying aegyo in the topline.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7mPqycQ0tQ,
SNSD,Way To Go,9,"As pop as pop-punk can get, the sound is a bit too sweetened up for my taste, but the song is still an undeniably rocking song that rocks harder than most of K-rock.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Ke2fThnG0,
SNSD,Genie,9,"Gets *too* repetitive for even my own taste, but it's still a pretty awesome song, also my dad went bonkers in the last part of it. Props.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SwiSpudKWI,
SNSD,Oh!,10,"Less viral than ""Gee"", but also better, basically taking everything that was good with the former song and marrying it to catchier melodies, snappier production, and better choreography. Some of SM's production magic also at play here, with how they merged the first two choruses to build that amazing third chorus.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGbwL8kSpEk,
SNSD,Run Devil Run,10,"<style type=""text/css""><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}</style>Not my favorite song from this era of SNSD, but I can't deny the sheer awesomeness of the song. Gritty backings, great swinging rock feel, and catchy as all fuck melodies. It also goes without saying, but SM productions are some amazing shit, a very interesting decision they made here was to pan the sibilance/aural excitation to the sides, so you hear the ""breathiness"" without it interfering the lead vocals and it adds a much appreciated depth to an already deep production. And, no, this wasn't a Kesha song, just in case.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_gfD3nvh-8,
SNSD,Hoot,10,"The best ""James Bond"" song from SM's ""James Bond"" songs that they have all their groups do, eventually.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4-SxcCO5d0,
SNSD,The Boys,9,"Falls a bit flat, but this is a high watermark in SM production and best represents the creative direction SM took at the turn of the decade. The song is saved from itself by the immaculate production. ""Trick"" outsold though.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pA_Tou-DPI,
SNSD,Mr. Taxi,10,"This, along with ""Paparazzi"" best exemplifies the mid-period SNSD sound. Rocking backings, punchy beat, and a sheer earworm for a chorus.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QDgMh_9Dy0,
SNSD,Dancing Queen,4,"Remake of Duffy's ""Mercy"" and sucks about as much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXZxc8GSXnI,
SNSD,I Got A Boy,5,"Not the Frankenstein's monster that many make it out to be, but it also certainly isn't K-pop's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". The seemingly random elements actually have a tight connection to each other, best shown in the eighth chorus section at 4:46, combining the fourth chorus section at 2:53 and third chorus section at 2:11. That being said, the amazing arrangement here isn't enough to make me like the song more than I already do.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq7ftOZBy0E,
SNSD,Mr. Mr.,4,"Because people were like ""hey don't do experimental shit with SNSD"", SM went and did something normal... And boring... It's like Sorry Sorry v5829.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8j_XEn9b_8,
SNSD,Catch Me If You Can,6,"Nine Muses did this song better with ""Hurt Locker"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b09U0KLv6I4,
SNSD,Party,1,"Sorry Taeyeon, I love you, but I'm only reserving my totally unbiased 10s to your solos and I'm gonna shit on your group's songs if I don't like them. Starts of fantastically hilarious with another one of Tiffany's English intros then grooves into the shitty generic summer house groove, and it doesn't get better than that with bland af songwriting. If the high point of your song is Tiffany's intro, you gotta think it isn't very good.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQzu7NYlZNQ,
SNSD,Lion Heart,8,"The verses are nothing worth noting but the chorus is one of SNSD's best, and SNSD has many great choruses in their discography.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVCubhQ454c,
SNSD,You Think,6,"Nowhere close their best material, but somewhat serviceable.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJYGddE0vHc,
SNSD,Sailing (0805),2,There's a reason why idol-made songs usually do not pass quality control.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlhR0zBFxZE,
SNSD,All Night,6,"Nice beat, but the song isn't much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4w8IbQTJpY,
SNSD,Holiday,2,Look at SNSD singing about something they never had for the first 10 years of their career. Talk about ruining my immersion!!!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwN-CN9EjTg,
SNSD,Overall,10,"SNSD introduced me to the concept of ""pop girl groups that don't suck"" and also ushered in an era of great pop girl group music, and I still thank them for that. Also, dad. Admittedly, I wasn't a big fan of them back during their debut era even when they had such awesome songs only because there are nine members I could barely recognize (blame poor video quality kek), although I was already in love with Taeyeon back then, my first ever K-pop crush, and she still is (although that's kinda weird now cos she's my dad and shit), I warmed up to SNSD soon thereafter because how can I not with their amazing discography and great variety performances. They slowed down in terms of musical quantity to me starting around 2013, but by then, they've already etched themselves to my heart as one of my all-time favorites.",,
T-ara,Lie,10,"One of the best debuts ever, overshadowed by stuff like ""Fire"" and ""Into The New World"", but I dare say this song is about as good as said iconic debuts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7qJMC5TLV8,
T-ara,Bo Peep Bo Peep,10,"A catchy as all fuck pop song about a Gumiho, with all the intended meaning of that theme choice - perfection.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpYvilmhONQ,
T-ara,Like The First Time,10,"Takes La Roux's already great song ""In For The Kill"" and somehow makes it BETTER. It's an amazingly catchy pop song, one of T-ara's best.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWSTtFoD0Ms,
T-ara,You Drive Me Crazy,10,"Britney copy as is the case with the handful of T-ara singles, and why not, when copying from the west, copy a good song. And T-ara makes ""Womanizer"" even better by having better songwriting and punchier textures.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d70FQdraoYI,
T-ara,I'm In Pain,10,"Everyone came from SNSD's ""Mr. Mr."" suits concept, but little did everyone know, Eunjung was actually the one who invented suits. And they kept the suits on for the entire MV too, unlike SNSD.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NobleBtJNiQ,
T-ara,What's Wrong,10,"Probably my 2nd favorite T-ara song. Apart from Britney, Abba is one of T-ara's most used inspiration, and while this doesn't scream a specific Abba song, all the things that made Abba songs good are here and made even better with modern sonic production. This is also one of K-pop's most Karaoke-able songs ever, alongside 4Minute's ""Heart To Heart"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7ewuda5th4,
T-ara,Yayaya,0,"Not even the ult-est of ults can escape a 0. And just as well, as ""Yayaya"" is a glaring mistake in T-ara's discography. Producers E-Tribe pretty much had one trick, which is that wall-of-noise style reminiscent of your favorite electro and industrial groups like Front Line Assembly and Kraftwerk; and it worked that one time in ""Gee"", but the reason it worked was because there's better songwriting and the backings actually worked in harmony with the topline. But this song is just wrong, of course the backings themselves are fine, but it really does not work with a nursery-style chanting bullshit, it just sounds so aggravating. But then, that kind of topline wouldn't work on any backing anyways. Unless you're singing about Satan and doing it on top of an industrial metal beat. For an example of this style of wall-of-noise done right, please refer to Oh My Girl's ""Coloring Book"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLfRdyqxXJk,
T-ara,Roly-Poly,11,"The ultimate K-pop disco song, and my favorite girl group song ever. The song is heavily inspired by Bee Gees - but has better songwriting, modern production, and less structural flats. It's simply pure pop perfection from a musical, sonic, and arrangement standpoint. Proof that you don't need to be overly complex in songwriting, as this song eschews the typical K-pop songwriting values in favour of something simple, and that often, simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. This was written in the time it takes to take a pee. Amazing intro on par with K-pop's best (think ""Sorry Sorry"", ""I Am The Best"", ""Lucifer""), Four chords that stay the same all throughout, verses that are probably the strongest verses in Kpop, with multiple melodies woven together leading to one of Kpop's best ever choruses, a spectacle of sublime pop catchiness, with an equally addictive choreography. Also have to talk about the hilarious rap break and how it's proof that all of us are bigger than our problems, Hwayoung couldn't ruin the song with her rap, and T-ara with her bullshit - T-ara actually became the second best-selling girl group behind SNSD after the ""scandal"", and was the Hallyu wave in China. Hence, we, too, should be reminded that we are bigger than our problems, and our problems are only the rap break, some unfortunate attempt to bring us down, but because all of us are Roly Polys we're not going to be brought down by it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyKdijPsPJw,
T-ara,Roly-Poly in Copacabana,10,"I still like the original better, but only slightly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xolk2cFzlo,
T-ara,Cry Cry,10,"Like I've said in ""You Drive Me Crazy"", Britney is a very common inspiration for T-ara, and they always make it better, this time by Flamenco-ing up ""Oops! I Did It Again"".",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M69TE1yzt4,
T-ara,Lovey-Dovey,10,"Roly Poly 2.0, it's also the inferior song, but still an absolute banger, and also has one of my favorite T-ara choreos.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ0djllyqwY,
T-ara,Day by Day,10,"Like I've said in ""You Drive Me Crazy"", Britney is a very common inspiration for T-ara, and they always make it better, this time by Ennio Morricone-ing up ""Criminal"". Also has the best MV ever.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb6mCsvLqP0,
T-ara,Sexy Love,10,"EBM x Dubstep x Pop music extravaganza, one of T-ara's best. One of the best MVs ever too.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShVRP09NCO4,
T-ara,Number Nine,10,T-ara went satanistic when they realized stupid K-netz will hate em regardless of what they do and they gave us a gem that is this song.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk52ypnGs68,
T-ara,Because I Know,10,"MBK ballads done right is the best type of ballad there is, benefiting from great songwriting, a mid-tempo beat, imaginative backings, and non-reliance on vocal caterwauling.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IzezDJrHoU,
T-ara,Do You Know Me,10,"Who knew Eunjung didn't have monopoly on short hair in T-ara? Jiyeon bias-wrecked me so hard during this era, and the experience was made even more pleasant as the song is another T-ara masterpiece, reminiscent of ""Wae Ireoni"". Actually a remake of Sand Pebbles' ""What Should I Do"", T-ara gives the psychedelic pop song a modern spin and makes it better.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6oprfVLxAQ,
T-ara,Hide & Seek,10,I told y'all MBK ballads are just a few steps ahead of the game.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyGV8RLey-8,
T-ara,Sugar Free,10,The ultimate K-pop club EDM banger. This pop/metal song just fucking bangs!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_eo5j5sib8,
T-ara,So Crazy,10,"Inferior to Bravesound's other amazing banger of that year in AOA's ""Heart Attack"", but utilizes similar ideas - and the result is still an amazing banger. The tremolo guitars and brisk rhythms are the star of the show, but the songwriting is also very strong.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maSoUetHock,
T-ara,Tiamo,10,eh eh eh eh eh eh eh. See MBK ballads really are the shit.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJHUKzz1vss,
T-ara,What's My Name?,10,"Originally a 7, but then I remember the feelings I've associated with this song...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eQTd-fsKsQ,
T-ara,Overall,10,"tl;dr my ults

Well, they're my ults, if I could give an overall score of 11, I'd ask if I can give 12 and write down 13. Much has been said by me about their music and how much I like them, and I really really do like their music, if my scores on them aren't indicative enough of my love for their music, I don't know what would. But despite all of that, the reason why they're my ults is for something much greater than music -  I related to them. Very deeply. You see, back during their ""exodus"" from Korea because of that bullshit ""scandal"", I was also facing troubling times, and it felt like I really connected with them; facing scrutiny from everyone I know and being forced to assume an identity because of other people's erroneous narrative. Their revival, and subsequent explosion in popularity in China and Mongolia as the face of the Hallyu Wave in the region (they're widely recognized in Korea and China as the biggest K-pop girl group in China and at one point around 2017 they were the runaway most popular K-pop group in China, about 90% of China's regions picked T-ara as the most popular group), really opened my eyes to the opportunities present to me if I step out of my comfort zone and welcomed change in my life, and boy did my life turn around for the better circa late 2015. K-pop has always been linked to changes in the outlook of impressionable young people's lives, for better or worse, and I can confidently say that this ""stupid gay kpoop bullshit"" helped me up because of T-ara. They were as instrumental as my faith in Jesus in shaping me into the person I am today, I owe so much to these lovely ladies who do not even know me, but I guess that's the power of music and one of the few benefits in being a celebrity. I just love them so much, and their reunion now is one of the best moments of my 2020, I shit you not, as shallow as that sounds, seeing my ults, who have helped me become the person I am today, getting back together and getting all the love and recognition that they deserve, really puts a smile to my face.",,
Wonder Girls,Irony,4,Songwriting falls a bit flat.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxFxoLxmcdg,
Wonder Girls,Tell Me,10,"Probably the first K-pop song to sound like the K-pop we all know, this stripped-back, smooth, and unabashedly 80s production (down to that sampled moaning) comes from K-pop's most retro producer (je wa pi) and the result is a better 80s song than most 80s songs. It's really simple too, but it works really well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlHv3BbBv6A,
Wonder Girls,So Hot,9,"The light electro feel coupled with the syncopated beat really lifts the song up. This is basically re-made in Wanna.B's ""Why?"" and that's also the better because it solves the problem this song had, namely the mixing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmun5PO54VE,
Wonder Girls,Nobody,10,"This fucking amazing Motown/80s hybrid should've been the direction JYP went with Wonder Girls, imagine what could've been.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBn1e9pr2Q,
Wonder Girls,2 Different Tears,5,"Another 80s gem from Wonder Girls, not the best thing they did, but still pretty good.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxh3_sr5UAE,
Wonder Girls,Be My Baby,5,Wonder Girls were unashamedly 80s and honestly did the 80s better than everyone else than average. They can even get pentatonic melodies right.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fy4cqWMhyI,
Wonder Girls,The DJ Is Mine,5,One of the reasons Wonder Girls' songwriting holds up is because it's married to brisk tempos and cool 80s sounds.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doXnuStEf2I,
Wonder Girls,Like This,10,"A better late 80s to early 90s R&B/Rap song than almost every song of that era. A cool old-school beat with infectious fun in the topline, with an MV that perfectly fits the vibe of the song.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EZTUYwjWBs,
Wonder Girls,Like Money,3,"People shit on this song and honestly it's all unwarranted, this song isn't the worst.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quE6Cq4Q2bs,
Wonder Girls,I Feel You,8,"A big 80s pop song without a big 80s pop chorus, ah what could've been. But even with a less than stellar chorus, the song is a fucking bop. And the album too, one of the best albums in pop music ever.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9QXQz6uE0M,
Wonder Girls,Why So Lonely,9,Wonder Girls can pull off any retro concept.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYGODWJgR-c,
Wonder Girls,Overall,10,"My first ever girl group, and sure ""Irony"" didn't stand out that much, and I thought ""Into The New World"" was better, and even though SNSD was the first to introduce me to the concept of ""pop girl groups that don't suck"" with said iconic debut, Wonder Girls is still the very first girl group I ever stanned. Part of it is because I was turned off by the sheer amount of members SNSD had, but a bigger part of it is because I enjoyed Wonder Girls' subsequent releases and I fell in love with their retro concept and quirkiness on TV. They're one of the most retro-sounding girl groups ever, and one of the best. Their music is honestly still top-tier to me and they really did not have any shit song. Shame they didn't become as popular as they should've been, but thankfully they're still rightfully remembered as one of the biggest players in the hallyu wave.",,
