**Sat (0):** "oof. Lets not talk about the mv. What producer thought this was good enough to be relases lol "
**Annie (0):** "Not even the ult-est of ults can escape a 0. And just as well, as "Yayaya" is a glaring mistake in T-ara's discography. Producers E-Tribe pretty much had one trick, which is that wall-of-noise style reminiscent of your favorite electro and industrial groups like Front Line Assembly and Kraftwerk; and it worked that one time in "Gee", but the reason it worked was because there's better songwriting and the backings actually worked in harmony with the topline. But this song is just wrong, of course the backings themselves are fine, but it really does not work with a nursery-style chanting bullshit, it just sounds so aggravating. But then, that kind of topline wouldn't work on any backing anyways. Unless you're singing about Satan and doing it on top of an industrial metal beat. For an example of this style of wall-of-noise done right, please refer to Oh My Girl's "Coloring Book"."

Starts of fantastically hilarious with another one of Tiffany's English intros then grooves into the shitty generic summer house groove, and it doesn't get better than that with bland af songwriting. If the high point of your song is Tiffany's intro, you gotta think it isn't very good."

**Loewe (7):** "The chorus saves this otherwise messy song."
**Annie (3):** "A hodge-podge of unfinished musical ideas, seriously, CL's part is a different song - a pedestrian trap section with a horrifying harmonica, Dara's is a boring build-up, while Bom's and Minzy's parts are the only sections with an actual semi-coherent idea, but on it's own, the generic Disco beat and rehashed early-YG style melodies isn't enough to carry a whole song, especially something as disjointed as this."

It's just like having sex, and just as you're getting there, you suddenly get a call from your mum asking you to buy soy sauce before you go home, then she hears your partner's breathing then suddenly accuses you of "not being the child I brought up" and saying "kids these days grow up so fast and leave their parents early" and then of course your partner hears that and suddenly everything becomes awkward and your libido dies down and won't recover for 2 whole years."

"Wanna" is a metal song disguising as a pure pop song what with the awesome metal-style pedal point harmonies and amazing keyboard-driven metal riffs. All that and with catchy as fuck melodies on top and great Queen-style harmonies and we have one of the best Kpop songs ever."

**Annie (5):** "Not the Frankenstein's monster that many make it out to be, but it also certainly isn't K-pop's "Bohemian Rhapsody". The seemingly random elements actually have a tight connection to each other, best shown in the eighth chorus section at 4:46, combining the fourth chorus section at 2:53 and third chorus section at 2:11. That being said, the amazing arrangement here isn't enough to make me like the song more than I already do."

Actually a remake of Sand Pebbles' "What Should I Do", T-ara gives the psychedelic pop song a modern spin and makes it better."

This is also one of K-pop's most Karaoke-able songs ever, alongside 4Minute's "Heart To Heart"."

The song could honestly work with that alone but the topline is also some catchy shit. This song remains one of K-pop's best dark concepts."

**Annie (11):** "The ultimate K-pop disco song, and my favorite girl group song ever. The song is heavily inspired by Bee Gees - but has better songwriting, modern production, and less structural flats. It's simply pure pop perfection from a musical, sonic, and arrangement standpoint. Proof that you don't need to be overly complex in songwriting, as this song eschews the typical K-pop songwriting values in favour of something simple, and that often, simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. This was written in the time it takes to take a pee. Amazing intro on par with K-pop's best (think "Sorry Sorry", "I Am The Best", "Lucifer"), Four chords that stay the same all throughout, verses that are probably the strongest verses in Kpop, with multiple melodies woven together leading to one of Kpop's best ever choruses, a spectacle of sublime pop catchiness, with an equally addictive choreography. Also have to talk about the hilarious rap break and how it's proof that all of us are bigger than our problems, Hwayoung couldn't ruin the song with her rap, and T-ara with her bullshit - T-ara actually became the second best-selling girl group behind SNSD after the "scandal", and was the Hallyu wave in China. Hence, we, too, should be reminded that we are bigger than our problems, and our problems are only the rap break, some unfortunate attempt to bring us down, but because all of us are Roly Polys we're not going to be brought down by it."

Song has more similarities with Stray Kid's "Side Effects" than almost anything else, cleverly using EBM-style backings to offset the cloying aegyo in the topline."

They started slow, but when they got it going, I could count in one hand the amount of groups who can match the quality of their output, but honestly, f(x) is still ahead of the pack. They don't have one, or two, they had THREE great full albums in "Pink Tape, "Red Light", and "4 Walls", not many K-pop groups can even make the claim of having ONE good mini album. And maybe it's the drugs talking, but I really vibed and related to their concept, and felt as if they were one of the most relatable groups out there, even when they weren't marketed as your typical idol group. Obviously the individual members are also very relatable, especially my bias Sulli... and now I'm crying, and rambling, but yes."

Then we have an amazing chorus, then amazing everything else. Also props for going away from K-pop's usual songwriting (circle-of-fifths and R&B) and using something more fun."

**Annie (9.57):** "tl;dr my ults

Well, they're my ults, if I could give an overall score of 11, I'd ask if I can give 12 and write down 13. Much has been said by me about their music and how much I like them, and I really really do like their music, if my scores on them aren't indicative enough of my love for their music, I don't know what would. But despite all of that, the reason why they're my ults is for something much greater than music -  I related to them. Very deeply. You see, back during their "exodus" from Korea because of that bullshit "scandal", I was also facing troubling times, and it felt like I really connected with them; facing scrutiny from everyone I know and being forced to assume an identity because of other people's erroneous narrative. Their revival, and subsequent explosion in popularity in China and Mongolia as the face of the Hallyu Wave in the region (they're widely recognized in Korea and China as the biggest K-pop girl group in China and at one point around 2017 they were the runaway most popular K-pop group in China, about 90% of China's regions picked T-ara as the most popular group), really opened my eyes to the opportunities present to me if I step out of my comfort zone and welcomed change in my life, and boy did my life turn around for the better circa late 2015. K-pop has always been linked to changes in the outlook of impressionable young people's lives, for better or worse, and I can confidently say that this "stupid gay kpoop bullshit" helped me up because of T-ara. They were as instrumental as my faith in Jesus in shaping me into the person I am today, I owe so much to these lovely ladies who do not even know me, but I guess that's the power of music and one of the few benefits in being a celebrity. I just love them so much, and their reunion now is one of the best moments of my 2020, I shit you not, as shallow as that sounds, seeing my ults, who have helped me become the person I am today, getting back together and getting all the love and recognition that they deserve, really puts a smile to my face."
**Cooper (8.9):** "what a journey me and t-ara have been on together, they have some of the biggest hits in kpop history and rightfully so. their mix of quirky beats & vocals with edm and r&b notes is so good, truly deserved to keep being one of the biggest girl groups"
**Loewe (8.81):** "CHAMELEON QUEENS! T-ara just BANG, and that stupid Yayaya song won't change that fact. Without that song, they'd be my highest rated group here, and that shows the power they hold."
**Claudia (8.24):** "T-ara bangers never dissapoint"

**Annie (10):** "Apink are fucking amazing. They are now 3/3 in their new sound and "Dumhdurum" is a bit like the first two combined, a bit closer texturally and musically to "I'm So Sick", but is similar to "%%" structurally, and is better than the two songs. What's super great about this song is it improves upon the only thing that I pointed out a *very slight weakness* in "%%" which is that the actual chorus melody is a bit weak, with both songs the actual stars of the show are the riffs, but in "Dumhdurum", they have a chorus section that doesn't just act as a prelude to the riff, but the actual chorus also fucking bangs."

**Annie (7.12):** "JYP got all his girl groups right, especially those he writes for, because more often than not, we get great songwriting and arrangement on their songs. I really really like Miss A though because they're the card I always play whenever people tell me I have an unjustifiable hate for R&B. I always tell them "I like R&B when it's good", and they'd be like "Oh, yeah? That's like bullshit, you hate on every R&B song ever", then I'd be like "Miss A are one of my favorite K-pop groups ever though, and they're R&B. Boom!" (important to note that I also like the more typical K-R&B like Shannon's "Hello" and Eyedi's "Best Mistake (k)"). Anyways, JYP really got Miss A right and it's a mystery to me why he can't replicate the same amount of success when writing for his boy groups."

**Annie (10):** "<style type="text/css"><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}</style>Not my favorite song from this era of SNSD, but I can't deny the sheer awesomeness of the song. Gritty backings, great swinging rock feel, and catchy as all fuck melodies. It also goes without saying, but SM productions are some amazing shit, a very interesting decision they made here was to pan the sibilance/aural excitation to the sides, so you hear the "breathiness" without it interfering the lead vocals and it adds a much appreciated depth to an already deep production. And, no, this wasn't a Kesha song, just in case."

**Loewe (8.71):** "2ne1 just BANGS man, and while their later output kinda not BANGS, their earlier output is up there in the best girl group releases ever."
**Annie (6.88):** "One of my favorite girl groups ever, 2NE1 were pretty much unstoppable during their peak from 2009-2012. and while sadly we didn't get as much songs from that time as we wanted, and they slowed down starting 2013, their back catalogue is still honestly pretty fucking solid. Not to mention they're quite easily the best K-pop girl group live show I've seen ever - "Nolza" and "Now Or Never" are some of the best K-pop concerts I'd ever been in, right up there with BigBang and BTS shows. 2NE1 just had charisma to burn, and despite the fact that their "Independent Women" persona is a corporate product (as is everything in a glamour industry), I still got caught in it and I thorougly enjoyed the girl crush experience."

**Loewe (9.0):** "My first girl group, as would be the case for many kpop fans who got into it in the same period that I did, and well, they fucking BANG. Started out banging and was really consistently banging all the way through, and they only really had one miss, that snore-inducing ballad. BUT YES THEY BANG."
**Cooper (7.41):** "put some respect on em"
**Annie (7.18):** "SNSD introduced me to the concept of "pop girl groups that don't suck" and also ushered in an era of great pop girl group music, and I still thank them for that. Also, dad. Admittedly, I wasn't a big fan of them back during their debut era even when they had such awesome songs only because there are nine members I could barely recognize (blame poor video quality kek), although I was already in love with Taeyeon back then, my first ever K-pop crush, and she still is (although that's kinda weird now cos she's my dad and shit), I warmed up to SNSD soon thereafter because how can I not with their amazing discography and great variety performances. They slowed down in terms of musical quantity to me starting around 2013, but by then, they've already etched themselves to my heart as one of my all-time favorites."

A group more closely associated to 2NE1 than SNSD, most people forget that 4Minute weren't all YOLO and had a very varied discography full of smooth, easy-listening gems like "Heart To Heart". Although of course their bad bitch image isn't unwarranted and they have great bomb-ass songs too. Also, I can't stress this enough, but 4Minute was weaponised by the South Korean government against North Korea, if that doesn't scream "Queen Shit Only", I don't know what would."

**Annie (7.09):** "My first ever girl group, and sure "Irony" didn't stand out that much, and I thought "Into The New World" was better, and even though SNSD was the first to introduce me to the concept of "pop girl groups that don't suck" with said iconic debut, Wonder Girls is still the very first girl group I ever stanned. Part of it is because I was turned off by the sheer amount of members SNSD had, but a bigger part of it is because I enjoyed Wonder Girls' subsequent releases and I fell in love with their retro concept and quirkiness on TV. They're one of the most retro-sounding girl groups ever, and one of the best. Their music is honestly still top-tier to me and they really did not have any shit song. Shame they didn't become as popular as they should've been, but thankfully they're still rightfully remembered as one of the biggest players in the hallyu wave."

The group themselves are very inspiring, in more ways than one, and I sorely miss them even to this day. Now I'm crying because I just remembered Hara and how her name rhymes with KARA and how she released "Midnight Queen" which sounds just like a KARA song from their peak and it just makes me really sad really."
